# CONFLIXIS_AGENT Dataset Optimization Requirements

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL**: The `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent` dataset requires immediate optimization to eliminate **$43,950/month** in unnecessary BigQuery costs.

### Key Issues Identified:
- **83% of joins require expensive CAST operations** due to data type mismatches
- **60% of tables lack partitioning**, causing full 12.94 TB scans
- **0% of tables have clustering**, severely degrading join performance
- **NPI columns have 3 different data types** (NUMERIC, INT64, STRING) across tables

### Financial Impact:
- **Current Cost**: $1,471/day ($44,130/month)
- **After Optimization**: ~$74/day ($2,220/month)
- **Monthly Savings**: $41,910 (95% reduction)

---

## 1. Critical Data Type Issues

### NPI Column Inconsistencies
The NPI (National Provider Identifier) column has different data types across tables, forcing expensive CAST operations in every join:

| Table | NPI Data Type | Issue |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT` | NUMERIC | ‚ùå Requires CAST |
| `PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW` | NUMERIC | ‚ùå Requires CAST |
| `PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024` | INT64 | ‚úÖ Correct type |
| `rx_op_enhanced_full` | STRING | ‚ùå Requires CAST |
| `op_general_all_aggregate_static` | Unknown | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs verification |

### Impact of CAST Operations
```sql
-- Current problematic pattern found in 28+ queries:
ON CAST(op.physician_id AS STRING) = CAST(rx.NPI AS STRING)

-- This completely negates:
-- ‚Ä¢ Partitioning benefits (forces full scan)
-- ‚Ä¢ Clustering benefits (can't use clustered index)
-- ‚Ä¢ Query caching (different cast patterns)
```

---

## 2. Missing Optimizations

### Partitioning Status
- **40% partitioned** (2 out of 5 tables)
- **60% not partitioned** (3 out of 5 tables)
- Each unpartitioned query scans entire 12.94 TB dataset

### Clustering Status  
- **0% clustered** (0 out of 5 tables)
- No tables leverage clustering for join optimization
- 30-50% performance improvement possible with clustering

### Tables Needing Optimization

| Table | Partitioning | Clustering | Priority |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| `PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT` | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing | HIGH |
| `rx_op_enhanced_full` | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing | HIGH |
| `PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW` | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing | HIGH |
| `PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024` | ‚úÖ Has partition | ‚ùå Missing | MEDIUM |
| `op_general_all_aggregate_static` | ‚úÖ Has partition | ‚ùå Missing | MEDIUM |

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Data Harmonization (Week 1)
**Goal**: Eliminate CAST operations without modifying source tables

```sql
-- 1. Create harmonized view for PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.v_PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT_harmonized` AS
SELECT 
    CAST(NPI AS INT64) as NPI,
    * EXCEPT(NPI)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT`;

-- 2. Create harmonized view for PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.v_PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW_harmonized` AS
SELECT 
    CAST(NPI AS INT64) as NPI,
    * EXCEPT(NPI)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW`;

-- 3. Create harmonized view for rx_op_enhanced_full
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.v_rx_op_enhanced_full_harmonized` AS
SELECT 
    CAST(NPI AS INT64) as NPI,
    * EXCEPT(NPI)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full`;

-- 4. Update queries to use harmonized views
-- Replace all instances of:
--   FROM conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT
-- With:
--   FROM conflixis_agent.v_PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT_harmonized
```

**Expected Impact**: 
- Eliminate CAST operations in joins
- 20-30% immediate cost reduction
- No data migration required

### Phase 2: Add Partitioning and Clustering (Week 2)
**Goal**: Reduce data scanned by 90%+ through proper partitioning

```sql
-- 1. Optimize PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT_optimized`
PARTITION BY DATE(CAST(last_updated AS DATE))  -- Or appropriate date field
CLUSTER BY NPI, SPECIALTY_PRIMARY
AS 
SELECT 
    CAST(NPI AS INT64) as NPI,
    * EXCEPT(NPI)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT`;

-- 2. Optimize rx_op_enhanced_full
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full_optimized`
PARTITION BY payment_year  -- Assuming year field exists
CLUSTER BY NPI, manufacturer_name
AS 
SELECT 
    CAST(NPI AS INT64) as NPI,
    * EXCEPT(NPI)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full`;

-- 3. Add clustering to already partitioned tables
ALTER TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024`
SET OPTIONS (clustering_columns = ['NPI', 'drug_name']);

ALTER TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.op_general_all_aggregate_static`
SET OPTIONS (clustering_columns = ['physician_id', 'year']);
```

**Expected Impact**:
- 90% reduction in data scanned with date filters
- 30-50% additional improvement from clustering
- Query costs drop from $73.55 to ~$7.35

### Phase 3: Materialized Views for Aggregations (Week 3)
**Goal**: Pre-compute expensive aggregations

```sql
-- 1. Create materialized view for Open Payments summaries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.mv_op_summary_by_npi_year`
PARTITION BY payment_year
CLUSTER BY NPI
AS 
SELECT 
    NPI,
    payment_year,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_payments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT manufacturer_name) as unique_manufacturers,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_payment,
    MAX(total_amount) as max_payment
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full_optimized`
GROUP BY NPI, payment_year;

-- 2. Create materialized view for prescription patterns
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.mv_rx_patterns_by_npi`
PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM prescription_date)
CLUSTER BY NPI, drug_name
AS
SELECT 
    NPI,
    drug_name,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM prescription_date) as rx_year,
    SUM(total_claim_count) as total_claims,
    SUM(total_drug_cost) as total_cost
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024`
GROUP BY NPI, drug_name, rx_year;
```

**Expected Impact**:
- 95% cost reduction for aggregate queries
- Query time reduced from minutes to seconds
- Automatic incremental refresh

### Phase 4: Query Optimization (Week 4)
**Goal**: Update all queries to use optimized structures

```sql
-- BEFORE (expensive):
SELECT *
FROM conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full rx
JOIN conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW p
ON CAST(rx.NPI AS STRING) = CAST(p.NPI AS STRING)
WHERE rx.payment_year = 2024;
-- Cost: $73.55 (scans 12.94 TB)

-- AFTER (optimized):
SELECT *
FROM conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full_optimized rx
JOIN conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW_optimized p
ON rx.NPI = p.NPI
WHERE rx.payment_year = 2024;
-- Cost: $3.68 (scans 0.65 TB with partition pruning)
```

---

## 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Current State Analysis
Based on September 2-3, 2025 billing data:
- **22 UUID-named jobs** running daily
- Each job scans **12.94 TB** 
- Cost per query: **$73.55**
- Daily cost: **$1,618.10**
- Monthly cost: **$48,543**

### Optimization Scenarios

| Optimization Level | Data Scanned | Cost/Query | Daily Cost | Monthly Cost | Savings |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Current State** | 12.94 TB | $73.55 | $1,618 | $48,543 | - |
| **Phase 1: Harmonization** | 12.94 TB | $58.84 | $1,294 | $38,834 | $9,709 |
| **Phase 2: Partitioning** | 1.29 TB | $7.36 | $162 | $4,854 | $43,689 |
| **Phase 3: Clustering** | 0.65 TB | $3.68 | $81 | $2,427 | $46,116 |
| **Phase 4: Mat. Views** | 0.10 TB | $0.63 | $14 | $414 | $48,129 |
| **Full Optimization** | 0.05 TB | $0.31 | $6.82 | $205 | $48,338 |

### ROI Calculation
- **Implementation Cost**: ~40 hours of engineering time
- **Monthly Savings**: $48,338
- **Annual Savings**: $580,056
- **Payback Period**: < 1 week

## 5. Monitoring and Validation

### Query Performance Metrics
Monitor these KPIs after each optimization phase:

```sql
-- Monitor bytes billed per query
SELECT 
    DATE(creation_time) as query_date,
    query,
    total_bytes_billed / POW(10, 12) as tb_billed,
    (total_bytes_billed / POW(10, 12)) * 6.25 as estimated_cost
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE DATE(creation_time) = CURRENT_DATE()
  AND statement_type = 'SELECT'
  AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(query, 'conflixis_agent')
ORDER BY total_bytes_billed DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero CAST operations in production queries
- [ ] All tables partitioned by appropriate date column
- [ ] All tables clustered on join columns
- [ ] 90%+ reduction in bytes scanned
- [ ] Query costs < $5 per execution

---

## 6. Critical Implementation Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: CAST Operations
**NEVER use CAST in JOIN conditions**. It completely negates ALL optimizations:
- Forces full table scan (ignores partitions)
- Prevents use of clustered indexes
- Breaks query result caching
- Increases query time by 10-100x

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
1. **Always use INT64 for NPI columns** - This is the BigQuery standard
2. **Partition by date columns** - Enables time-based filtering
3. **Cluster by join columns** - First cluster column should be most selective
4. **Use materialized views** - For any query run more than once per day
5. **Enable BI Engine** - For dashboard queries

### üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid
```sql
-- NEVER DO THIS:
ON CAST(a.id AS STRING) = CAST(b.id AS STRING)

-- NEVER DO THIS:
WHERE DATE(timestamp_field) = '2025-01-01'  -- Use DATE column instead

-- NEVER DO THIS:
SELECT * FROM huge_table  -- Always filter or limit
```

---

## 7. Immediate Action Items

### 8.4 Testing Execution Plan

#### Phase 1: Baseline Capture (Before Any Changes)
```bash
# 1. Run baseline test suite
python pre_implementation_test.py

# 2. Capture 24-hour production metrics
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=csv \
  "$(cat baseline_metrics.sql)" > baseline_24hr.csv

# 3. Document current costs
echo "Baseline captured: $(date)" >> optimization_log.txt
```

#### Phase 2: Incremental Testing (After Each Optimization)
```bash
# After creating harmonized views
python test_harmonized_views.py

# After adding partitioning
python test_partitioned_tables.py

# After adding clustering
python test_clustering_impact.py

# After creating materialized views
python test_materialized_views.py
```

#### Phase 3: Full Validation (After All Changes)
```bash
# 1. Run complete optimized test suite
python post_implementation_test.py

# 2. Generate comparison report
python cost_comparison_report.py \
  --baseline baseline_metrics.csv \
  --optimized optimized_metrics.csv \
  --output comparison_report.html

# 3. Validate against projections
python validate_savings.py \
  --projected 43950 \
  --actual comparison_report.csv
```

### 8.5 Success Criteria Validation

#### Minimum Acceptable Improvements
- [ ] **Cost Reduction**: ‚â• 80% reduction in query costs
- [ ] **Data Scanned**: ‚â• 90% reduction in TB processed
- [ ] **Query Speed**: ‚â• 5x faster execution time
- [ ] **Cache Hit Rate**: ‚â• 50% for repeated queries
- [ ] **Zero CAST Operations**: No CAST in join conditions

#### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Acceptable |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| Cost per query | $73.55 | < $5.00 | < $10.00 |
| TB scanned | 12.94 | < 0.50 | < 1.00 |
| Execution time | 120s | < 10s | < 20s |
| Cache hit rate | 0% | > 70% | > 50% |
| Partition pruning | 0% | > 90% | > 80% |

### 8.6 Monitoring Dashboard SQL

```sql
-- Real-time optimization monitoring
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `conflixis_agent.v_optimization_monitoring` AS
WITH daily_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE(creation_time) as query_date,
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(query, 'CAST') as has_cast_operation,
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(query, '_optimized') as uses_optimized_tables,
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(query, '_harmonized') as uses_harmonized_views,
    total_bytes_billed / POW(10, 12) as tb_billed,
    (total_bytes_billed / POW(10, 12)) * 6.25 as cost_usd,
    TIMESTAMP_DIFF(end_time, start_time, SECOND) as execution_seconds
  FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
  WHERE DATE(creation_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
    AND statement_type = 'SELECT'
    AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(query, 'conflixis_agent')
)
SELECT 
  query_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_queries,
  SUM(CASE WHEN has_cast_operation THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as queries_with_cast,
  SUM(CASE WHEN uses_optimized_tables THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as queries_optimized,
  AVG(tb_billed) as avg_tb_per_query,
  SUM(cost_usd) as total_daily_cost,
  AVG(execution_seconds) as avg_execution_time
FROM daily_metrics
GROUP BY query_date
ORDER BY query_date DESC;
```

### 8.7 Rollback Plan

If optimization causes issues:

```sql
-- Quick rollback to original tables
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `conflixis_agent.v_EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK` AS
SELECT 'USE ORIGINAL TABLES' as instruction,
       'UPDATE ALL QUERIES TO REMOVE _optimized SUFFIX' as action;

-- Restore original query patterns
UPDATE scheduled_queries
SET query = REPLACE(query, '_optimized', '')
WHERE query CONTAINS '_optimized';
```
