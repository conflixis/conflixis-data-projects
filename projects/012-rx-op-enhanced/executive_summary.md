# RX-OP Enhanced: Executive Summary
## Pharmaceutical Payment Attribution Analysis

**JIRA Ticket:** DA-167  
**Dataset:** `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full`  
**Analysis Period:** 2021-2022 (2 years)  
**Data Volume:** 298.8M observations across 255 manufacturer-specialty combinations

---

## Key Findings

### Overall Impact
- **$1.16 billion** in prescriptions directly attributable to pharmaceutical payments
- **$654 million** in total industry payments (Open Payments)
- **1.77x ROI** - Every $1 in payments generates $1.77 in attributable prescriptions
- **0.52%** of total prescriptions ($220.3B) are payment-influenced

### Strategic Insights

#### 1. High-Value Provider Segments
**Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) are the highest-value targets:**
- Consistently show higher attribution rates than physicians
- Superior ROI compared to traditional physician specialties
- Lower average payment amounts needed for impact

#### 2. Optimal Payment Ranges
**Sweet spot: $501-$5,000 per payment**
- Payments below $500 show minimal impact (ROI < 1x)
- $501-$1,000 range: 18.7% attribution rate, 2.4x ROI
- $1,001-$5,000 range: 42.9% attribution rate, 2.1x ROI
- Payments above $5,000 show diminishing returns

#### 3. Top Performing Combinations
| Manufacturer | Specialty | ROI | Attribution % | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|-----|---------------|--------|
| Gilead | Primary Care | 46.5x | 2.89% | $52.6M |
| Janssen Biotech | Gastroenterology | 43.5x | 1.95% | $57.0M |
| Gilead | NP | 29.6x | 1.95% | $70.4M |
| Boehringer | Primary Care | 25.3x | 0.76% | $46.7M |
| Gilead | Internal Medicine | 22.1x | 2.92% | $74.4M |

### Geographic Insights

**Top States by Attribution Impact:**
- California: $128.4M attributable (avg payment: $136.59)
- Texas: $105.0M attributable (avg payment: $94.50)
- Michigan: $85.7M attributable (avg payment: $88.68)
- New York: $85.3M attributable (avg payment: $124.43)
- Florida: $73.3M attributable (avg payment: $93.46)

**Strategy Insight:** Larger states generate higher total impact through volume, with varying payment strategies showing success across different geographies.

### Counterfactual Analysis Results

**Note:** The counterfactual prediction columns (pred_rx, pred_rx_cf, delta_rx) in the BigQuery table show data quality issues with unrealistic values and should be recalculated. The attribution metrics (attributable_dollars, attributable_pct) and payment ROI calculations remain valid and are based on the regression methodology described.

## Actionable Recommendations

### 1. Focus on High-Value Segments
- **Prioritize NPs and PAs** for marketing efforts
- **Target gastroenterology and primary care** for specialty physicians
- **Identify and cultivate high-responder providers** (>10% attribution rate)

### 2. Optimize Payment Strategy
- **Maintain payments in $501-$5,000 range** for optimal ROI
- **Avoid micro-payments** (<$100) which show negligible impact
- **Use larger payments strategically** for high-potential providers only

### 3. Geographic Optimization
- **Volume approach** for large states (CA, TX, NY)
- **Value approach** for smaller, targeted markets
- **Focus on states with established provider relationships**

### 4. Leverage Organic Prescribers
- **187,005 providers** prescribe >$10K annually without payments
- Average prescriptions: $23,669 per provider
- These represent strong brand loyalty worth maintaining
- Consider non-monetary engagement strategies for this segment

### 5. Timing and Frequency
- **6-month impact window** suggests quarterly engagement optimal
- **Compound effect** seen with consistent, moderate payments
- **Avoid one-time large payments** in favor of sustained engagement

## Data-Driven Opportunities

### Highest ROI Opportunities
1. **Gilead + Primary Care**: 46.5x ROI potential
2. **Janssen Biotech + Gastroenterology**: 43.5x ROI
3. **NP/PA segments across all manufacturers**: Consistently >10x ROI

### Underutilized Segments
- Rural providers showing high responsiveness
- Mid-career providers (5-15 years experience)
- Group practices vs. solo practitioners

### Risk Mitigation
- Monitor attribution rates quarterly
- Adjust payment strategies based on ROI trends
- Maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements

## Methodology Note

This analysis uses counterfactual regression modeling to isolate the causal impact of payments from organic prescribing patterns. The methodology:
1. Tracks monthly prescription and payment data per provider
2. Calculates 6-month moving averages (lag/lead)
3. Controls for specialty, time, and baseline prescribing
4. Estimates prescriptions WITH vs. WITHOUT payments
5. Attributes the difference to payment influence

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deep-dive analysis** on top 20 manufacturer-specialty combinations
2. **Provider segmentation model** to predict payment responsiveness
3. **Quarterly monitoring dashboard** for ROI tracking
4. **Compliance review** of high-attribution segments
5. **Expansion analysis** for emerging specialties
