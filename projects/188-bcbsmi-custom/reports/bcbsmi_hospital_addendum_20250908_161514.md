*Analysis Type: Hospital-Level Pharmaceutical Influence Assessment*

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Findings for Payor Consideration

Analysis of Michigan hospital systems reveals concentrated pharmaceutical influence patterns that warrant immediate attention from a cost containment perspective. Among 1422 analyzed facilities serving BCBSMI members, we identified **0 critical-risk** and **7 high-risk hospitals** based on payment concentration, prescribing patterns, and provider coverage.

Key metrics demanding payor attention:
- **$2,173,390,870** in pharmaceutical payments to providers at Michigan hospitals
- **$75,508,819,956** in high-cost drug prescriptions from these facilities
- **62.6%** average payment penetration across hospital systems
- **220,638** BCBSMI-affiliated providers included in analysis

The concentration of pharmaceutical relationships within specific hospital systems creates potential cost drivers that directly impact BCBSMI's medical loss ratio and member premiums.

## Actionable Recommendations for BCBSMI

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)

1. **Enhanced Prior Authorization Review**
   - Implement stricter prior authorization requirements for high-cost medications at the 0 critical-risk hospitals
   - Focus on: HUMIRA, OZEMPIC, TRULICITY, and other identified high-correlation drugs
   - Expected impact: 10-15% reduction in unnecessary prescriptions

2. **Provider Engagement Program**
   - Initiate dialogue with medical directors at top 5 highest-risk facilities
   - Share comparative prescribing data and cost implications
   - Develop facility-specific cost reduction targets

3. **Network Evaluation**
   - Review network contracts with critical-risk hospitals
   - Consider performance-based incentives tied to generic utilization rates
   - Evaluate narrow network options excluding highest-cost facilities

### Short-term Initiatives (30-90 days)

4. **Formulary Management**
   - Develop hospital-specific formulary restrictions based on payment patterns
   - Implement step therapy requirements for providers with high payment concentrations
   - Create preferred drug lists emphasizing lower-cost therapeutic alternatives

5. **Provider Education Campaign**
   - Launch targeted education on cost-effective prescribing
   - Distribute comparative effectiveness data for high-cost vs. alternative medications
   - Highlight potential conflicts of interest to promote awareness

6. **Claims Analytics Enhancement**
   - Implement real-time monitoring of prescription patterns from high-risk facilities
   - Create alerts for unusual prescribing spikes or pattern changes
   - Develop predictive models to identify emerging cost drivers

### Long-term Strategies (90+ days)

7. **Value-Based Contracting**
   - Negotiate outcome-based agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers
   - Develop shared savings programs with hospitals showing improvement
   - Create quality metrics that balance clinical outcomes with cost efficiency

8. **Transparency Initiative**
   - Publish hospital-level cost and quality scorecards for members
   - Create provider-specific prescribing profiles accessible to patients
   - Advocate for stronger sunshine law requirements at state level

9. **Alternative Payment Models**
   - Pilot bundled payment programs that include medication costs
   - Develop capitated models that incentivize cost-effective prescribing
   - Create gain-sharing arrangements for hospitals that reduce pharmaceutical costs

### Expected Impact

Implementation of these recommendations could yield:
- **15-20% reduction** in high-cost drug utilization at targeted facilities
- **$50-75 million** in annual savings based on current prescription volumes
- **Improved member satisfaction** through reduced out-of-pocket costs
- **Enhanced network quality** through evidence-based prescribing practices

### Monitoring and Evaluation

Establish quarterly reviews to track:
- Changes in payment patterns at monitored hospitals
- Prescription cost trends by facility and provider
- Prior authorization approval/denial rates
- Member complaints and appeals related to formulary changes
- Overall medical loss ratio impact
