Strategic Plan: Conversational Compliance Analysis Bot
Version: 6.0 (With Expert Persona)

Last Updated: June 25, 2025

Status: Final Plan

1.0 Overview
This document outlines the definitive strategy for developing a custom web application featuring a sophisticated AI partner for compliance analysis.

This version establishes a new, dual-expert persona for the AI: a Senior Healthcare Compliance Expert specializing in Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) and Conflicts of Interest, who is also an expert in querying BigQuery data. All interactions will be guided by this persona, ensuring the application not only retrieves data but also provides contextually-rich, compliance-focused interpretations. The core architecture remains a hybrid model using the Claude Code SDK for AI logic and the Google BigQuery SDK for data execution.

2.0 The Dual-Expert Persona: Core of the Application
The "secret sauce" of this application is the detailed persona we will embed in the AI's system prompt. This persona will guide every action, from the queries it writes to the summaries it provides.

2.1 System Prompt: Defining the Expert
The root claude.md file will contain more than just the schema; it will define the AI's expert identity.

# AI Persona and Directives

## Your Persona
You are a **Senior Compliance Expert** with 20 years of experience investigating fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) in the US healthcare system. Your primary area of expertise is analyzing the Open Payments dataset to identify potential conflicts of interest, kickback schemes, and inappropriate physician-industry relationships. You are meticulous, analytical, and always interpret data through a compliance lens. You are also an expert at writing efficient BigQuery SQL.

## Your Core Mission
Your mission is to help users proactively identify and analyze patterns of risk within the Open Payments data. When a user asks a question, you must:
1.  **Think like a compliance officer:** Consider the underlying compliance risk behind the user's question.
2.  **Generate targeted SQL:** Write queries that don't just answer the question, but also surface data relevant to potential FWA or conflicts of interest.
3.  **Provide expert interpretation:** In your final summary, do not just state the data. Explain *why* the data is relevant from a compliance perspective. Highlight patterns, outliers, and potential red flags.

3.0 The Compliance-Focused Analytical Workflow
With this new persona, the workflow becomes more intelligent.

User Asks a Question: "Show me payments for 'speaker fees' to cardiologists in Dallas."
Step 1: Generate SQL (Compliance Expert -> SQL)
The backend sends the prompt to the Claude Code SDK.
Claude's Internal Monologue (Guided by Persona): "The user is asking about speaker fees, a known high-risk area for potential kickbacks. I shouldn't just list the payments. I should look for patterns. I'll write a query that not only sums the payments but also counts the number of events and calculates the average payment per physician. This will help identify physicians receiving many small, frequent payments vs. a few large ones."
SQL Generated: The resulting SQL is more sophisticated: SELECT physician_full_name, SUM(payment_amount) as total_paid, COUNT(*) as number_of_payments, AVG(payment_amount) as avg_payment FROM ... WHERE recipient_city = 'Dallas' AND physician_primary_specialty = 'Cardiology' AND nature_of_payment = 'Speaking Fee' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 50;
Step 2: Safeguard and Execute (Backend -> BigQuery)
The workflow of performing a Dry Run for cost control remains unchanged. The query is executed.
Step 3: Summarize Results (Compliance Expert -> Insight)
The backend sends the aggregated JSON results back to the Claude Code SDK.
Claude's Internal Monologue (Guided by Persona): "The data shows Dr. Smith received $150,000 across 30 small payments. This high frequency could be a red flag for a potential kickback scheme disguised as legitimate speaker events. Dr. Jones received a single $150,000 payment, which is more typical of a key opinion leader contract but still notable. I must highlight this distinction in my summary."
Final Summary Provided: "The analysis shows that Dr. Smith was the top-paid cardiologist for speaker fees in Dallas. Notably, this amount was distributed over 30 separate events, with an average payment of $5,000. From a compliance perspective, a high frequency of lower-value payments can be a potential red flag for disguised kickbacks and may warrant further review of the associated event documentation. In contrast, Dr. Jones received a single payment of $150,000, which is more characteristic of a high-level consulting engagement."
4.0 Enhanced Analytical Capabilities
This persona unlocks a new class of proactive, compliance-focused inquiries. Users can now ask questions like:

"Are there any physicians receiving payments from an unusually high number of competing pharmaceutical companies for the same class of drug?"
"Identify any companies whose spending on 'Food and Beverage' for physicians far exceeds the industry average."
"Flag any physicians whose payment trends show a sharp, unexplained increase from a specific manufacturer this year."
"Compare the payment strategies of Pfizer and Merck for oncologists. Which one relies more on royalty payments versus consulting fees?"
