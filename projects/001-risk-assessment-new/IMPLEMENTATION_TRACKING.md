# Risk Assessment Notebook Implementation Tracking

## Project Overview
**Date Started**: 2025-06-24  
**Notebook**: Risk_assessment_new.ipynb  
**Purpose**: Make the Risk Assessment notebook fully functional for analyzing BCBS NPI payment data (7.5M records) from BigQuery

## Implementation Plan Summary
1. **Phase 1**: Version control - commit and push initial notebook
2. **Phase 2**: Make notebook functional with proper setup, documentation, and visualizations
3. **Phase 3**: Testing and validation
4. **Phase 4**: Final commit with all improvements

## Observations

### Initial Review (2025-06-24 11:00)
1. **Good Practices Found**:
   - All queries use aggregation (SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY)
   - LIMIT clauses used appropriately for exploration
   - No raw data downloads (only aggregated results)
   - Clear query structure with proper formatting

2. **Missing Components**:
   - No initialization/setup code
   - No imports or environment configuration
   - No visualizations for results
   - No error handling
   - No documentation explaining queries
   - No data export functionality

---

## Recommendations for Improvements

### Immediate Improvements (Being Implemented)
1. **Setup & Configuration**
   - Add proper imports and environment setup
   - Create reusable query execution function
   - Add BigQuery client configuration

2. **Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive overview
   - Document each query's purpose
   - Explain the data schema

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar charts for top entities/specialties
   - Distribution plots for payments
   - Heatmaps for entity-specialty matrices

### Future Improvements (Post-Implementation)
1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Time series analysis (if date columns exist)
   - Statistical testing for payment distributions
   - Correlation analysis between variables
   - Outlier detection for unusual payments

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Create BigQuery views for common aggregations
   - Implement query result caching
   - Use BigQuery ML for predictive analytics

3. **Reporting**
   - Automated report generation
   - Executive summary dashboard
   - Email distribution of key findings

4. **Data Quality**
   - Add data validation checks
   - Monitor for missing values
   - Track data freshness

## Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] All cells have proper markdown documentation
- [ ] Error handling implemented for queries
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use variables)
- [ ] Efficient BigQuery usage (no unnecessary data transfer)
- [ ] Clear variable names and comments
- [ ] Reproducible results

## Performance Metrics

### Query Performance
Will track after implementation:
- Average query execution time
- Data transfer size per query
- Memory usage
- Total notebook execution time

### BigQuery Usage
- Bytes processed per query
- Query cost estimation
- Cache hit rate
