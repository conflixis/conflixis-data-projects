# BigQuery Optimization Implementation Progress

**Project**: GCP BigQuery Billing Optimization  
**Jira Ticket**: DA-186  
**Target Dataset**: `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_data_projects`  
**Start Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: üü° In Progress

## Executive Summary

Optimizing the `conflixis_agent` dataset to reduce BigQuery costs from **$1,471/day** to **~$74/day** (95% reduction) when queries are actively running.

## Current Phase: Week 1 - Data Harmonization

### Milestones

| Week | Phase | Status | Start Date | Completion | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Data Harmonization | üîÑ Not Started | 2025-09-08 | - | Create harmonized views with INT64 types |
| 2 | Partitioning & Clustering | ‚è≥ Pending | - | - | Add partitioning and clustering |
| 3 | Materialized Views | ‚è≥ Pending | - | - | Pre-compute expensive aggregations |
| 4 | Migration & Testing | ‚è≥ Pending | - | - | Update queries and validate savings |

## Implementation Tasks

### Week 1: Data Harmonization
- [x] Run schema analysis script
- [x] Identify data type mismatches - Found NPI with NUMERIC, INT64, STRING types
- [ ] Create harmonized views for all tables with NPI columns
- [ ] Test joins without CAST operations
- [ ] Validate data consistency
- [ ] Measure initial performance improvements

### Week 2: Partitioning & Clustering
- [ ] Identify optimal partition columns (date fields)
- [ ] Determine clustering columns (join keys)
- [ ] Create optimized tables in `conflixis_data_projects`
- [ ] Load data into new tables
- [ ] Validate partition pruning works

### Week 3: Materialized Views
- [ ] Identify top expensive aggregation queries
- [ ] Create materialized view for Open Payments summaries
- [ ] Create materialized view for prescription patterns
- [ ] Set up refresh schedules
- [ ] Test query performance

### Week 4: Migration & Testing
- [ ] Update production queries to use new tables
- [ ] Run side-by-side comparisons
- [ ] Document performance improvements
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Final validation of cost savings

## Risks and Issues

### Active Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| Data type conversion errors | High | Medium | Test thoroughly with sample data | Monitoring |
| Query incompatibility | Medium | Low | Keep original tables for rollback | Monitoring |
| Performance degradation for edge cases | Low | Low | Benchmark all query patterns | Monitoring |

### Resolved Issues
| Date | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2025-09-08 | Script path issues after reorganization | Fixed .env file path references |

## Performance Metrics

### Baseline (Before Optimization)
- **Daily Cost**: $1,471 (when queries run)
- **Data Scanned per Query**: 12.94 TB
- **Average Query Time**: ~120 seconds
- **CAST Operations**: 83% of joins

### Current Performance
- **Daily Cost**: TBD
- **Data Scanned per Query**: TBD
- **Average Query Time**: TBD
- **CAST Operations**: TBD

### Target Performance
- **Daily Cost**: ~$74
- **Data Scanned per Query**: <0.65 TB
- **Average Query Time**: <10 seconds
- **CAST Operations**: 0%

## Cost Tracking

| Date | Queries Run | Total TB Scanned | Daily Cost | Notes |
|------|------------|------------------|------------|-------|
| Baseline | 22 | 284.68 | $1,471 | Before optimization |
| TBD | - | - | - | After Week 1 |
| TBD | - | - | - | After Week 2 |
| TBD | - | - | - | After Week 3 |
| TBD | - | - | - | After Week 4 |

## Rollback Procedures

### If Issues Occur:
1. All original tables remain in `conflixis_agent` dataset
2. Update queries to point back to original tables
3. Document issue for resolution
4. Re-attempt after fixes

### Rollback Commands:
```sql
-- Quick rollback: Update views to point to original tables
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW conflixis_data_projects.v_table_name AS
SELECT * FROM conflixis_agent.table_name;
```

## Notes and Learnings

### 2025-09-08
- Project restructured with clear folder organization
- Created tracking documentation
- Ready to begin Week 1 implementation
- Schema analysis completed successfully:
  - Confirmed 83% of joins require CAST operations
  - Found NPI column with 3 different data types (NUMERIC, INT64, STRING)
  - Identified 5 tables needing optimization
  - 0% of tables have clustering (major performance opportunity)
  - Only 40% of tables are partitioned

## Next Steps

1. Execute `scripts/01_schema_analysis.py` to analyze current state
2. Review generated recommendations
3. Create harmonized views in `sql/harmonized_views.sql`
4. Test performance improvements
5. Update this document with results
