 1 Introduction  
Open Payments, which is managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is a 
national disclosure program created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The program promotes 
transparency and accountability by helping consumers understand the financial relationships 
between pharmaceutical and medical device companies , physicians, N on-Physician Practitioners 
(NPP) and teaching hospitals. The health care providers included in Open Payments are collectively 
referred to as ‘covered recipients’.  
• In 2021,  the Open Payments Program was expanded to include: physician assistants, nurse 
practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives. For the purpose of the Open Payments program, this 
particular subset of covered recipeints are referred to as, “Non- Physician Practitioners 
(NPPs) ”. NPPs are reportable for Program Year  (PY) 2021 and all subsequent years.  
These financial relationships may include consulting fees, research grants, travel reimbursements, 
and payments made from the industry to medical practitioners.  
It is important to note that financial ties between reporting entities and covered recipients  do not 
necessarily indicate an improper relationship; the data is open to personal interpretation.  
This document provides a guide to how CMS publishes the informational data gathered by Open 
Payments for public use. It explains the sources of the data, the data files that are available from CMS, 
and the fields contained in each data file. View the data and learn more about the Open Payments 
program by visiting

 2 Methodology 
The Open Payments program functions on a yearly cycle of four key activities: (1) Data Collection, (2) 
Data Submission, (3) Pre -Publication Review, Dispute , and Correction, and (4) Data Publication.  
Reporting entities collect data on payments made to covered recipients from January 1 through December 31 of each year, along with any ownership or investment interests held by physicians or 
physicains ’ immediate family members in the reporting entity during that time. Following the data 
collection, r eporting entities  are require d to submi t this data to CMS.   
This data may be reviewed and, if necessary, disputed by the covered recipient  associated with the 
record(s) in the Open Payments system ..  
Data submitted to Open Payments that are eligible for publication is published twice annually: first, in 
an initial publication, and then in a refresh publication. Refer to Section 2.3 for more information. 
Publishing rules, limitations, and exclusions are given in Section 2.6. The data is made available on the 
Open Payments public data site, also called the search tool,  at (
https://op enpay mentsdata.cms.gov/).  
Figure 2-1, below, provides a high-level representation of the various steps  during a given PY. Exact 
dates for the current PY are given in Appendix A:  Key Dates for the Open Payments  System for PY 
2023.

 2.1 Steps 1 and 2: Data Collection and Submission  
Applicable Manufacturers and applicable GPOs submit their data for a PY during a designated submission 
period in the subsequent calendar year. For example, data collected from January 1- December 31, 2023 
(“Program Year 2023”)  was submitted during the submission period, which ran from February 1 to March 
31, 2024.  During the submission period, Applicable Manufacturers and applicable GPOs may also submit 
data from prior  PYs as well as update previously submitted data. 
Physicians and Non -Physician Practitioners  (NPPs) may be identified as covered recipients of payments 
or transfers of value s or as principal investigators associated with research-related payment records. 
Applicable Manufacturers and applicable GPOs are required to include the names of the  covered 
recipients  and other identifying information, including the covered recipient ’s state medical license 
number(s) and National Provider Identifier (NPI), if the covered recipient h as one. These details aid in 
accurately identifying the covered recipient (s) associated with each record.  
Teaching hospitals may also be identified as covered recipients. Teaching hospitals are defined by CMS 
as any hospitals receiving payments for Medicare direct graduate medical education (GME), inpatient 
prospective payment system (IPPS), indirect medical education (IME), or psychiatric hospital IME 
programs during the last calendar year for which such information is available. CMS has made available 
lists of reportable teaching hospitals for each PY, which is available  on the Resources page of the Open 
Payments website (https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/About/Resources.html). 
During the submission process, the Open Payments system checks the submitted information to verify 
that the reported identifying data matches valid physicians, NPPs , and teaching  hospitals. This initial 
system matching can result in some records being rejected. These records must be corrected and re-
submitted by the Applicable Manufacturer or applicable GPO in order for the records to be eligible for 
review, dispute, and publication. 
2.2 Step 3: Review and Dispute Data/Review and Correct Data  
Physicians, NPPs,  and teaching  hospitals may review the data attributed to them in the Open Payments 
system prior to its publication. Their participation is voluntary, but they can choose to  affirm their data 
is correct or dispute any data they believe to be inaccurate. Each PY has a designated pre-publication 
review, dispute, and correction period that follows  the data subm issio n period. The PY 2023  dates for 
this period and all other periods referenced in this section are provided in Appendix A. 
The pre- publication review, dispute, and correction period starts with a 45-day review and dispute 
period (April 1 – May 15)  for covered recipients , to review, affirm, or if necessary dispute records that 
were attributed to them , and work with the Applicable Manufacturer or Applicable GPO to resolve 
any disputed record(s); this includes records submitted for the previous PY and any newly submitted 
records from prior PYs. Similarly , records  that are flagged for delay in publication by the reporting 
entity are eligible for review and dispute by physicians, NPPs , and teaching hospitals. Open Payments Methodology Overview & Data Dictionary   OMB Control No: 0938 -1237 
Expiration Date: 07/31/2026  
 
8 
 Imm ediately following the pre-publication 45-day review and dispute period is an additional 15-day 
correction period for reporting entities, from  May 16 to May 30, to make final corrections to records 
and resolve any active disputes ahead of the annual data publication  
The designated pre- publication review and dispute period affects how the record is displayed in the initial  
data publication. Covered recipients may continue reviewing, affirming,  and/ or disputing records within 
the Open Payments System through the end of the calendar year (December 31). However, data that is 
disputed after the pre -publication review and dispute period will not be published as disputed or 
published with corrected information until a subsequent data refresh or data publication.  
• More information about how disputes affect records eligible for publication is 
provided  in Section 2.3.1 , Effects of Disputes on D ata Pubication .After December 31 , 
records that were  available for review and dispute will no longer be available to review or 
dispute within the Open Payments system . For example, records submitted during the PY  
2023 submission period (February 1 –  March 31, 2024) were  available in the Open 
Payments system  between Apri1 1, 2024 and May 15, 2024 for the designated pre-
publicatio n Review  and Dispute period. These records will  remain available through 
December 31, 2024  for covered recipient review and dispute activities.   
 
On January 1, 2025, these records will not be available within the Open Payments 
System for review and dispute. If a covered recipient wishes to take action on any of 
these r ecords after the December 31 deadline, they must work with the reporting 
entity outside of the Open Payments System to reach a resolution.    
Therefore, covered recipients should still continue to seek a resolution until a dispute is resolved, 
and are encouraged to contact the reporting entity outside of the Open Payments system if any 
corrections are required to the published data after the end of the calendar year .  
2.3 Step 4: Data Publication  
Only data submitted and attested to by the submission closing date is eligible for publication in the 
subsequent initial and refresh publications. Data submitted and attested after the submission closing 
date is considered late and will not be eligible for publication until the initial publication in the following 
calendar year. The Modified -Without-Dispute Cutoff Date is the end date for edits to undisputed record 
to be included in the r efresh publication ; data that did not have any dispute s against it and was modified 
after the modified- without -dispute cutoff date in November, will not be available for review and dispute 
until the next calendar year during the review and dispute period.  This data will not be included  for the 
refresh publication but will be eligible for the next initial publication. 
Data submitted to Open Payments that are eligible for publication is published twice annually, as 
explained below. Explanations of record limitations, exclusions, and ineligibility are provided in Section 
2.6. Open Payments Methodology Overview & Data Dictionary   OMB Control No: 0938 -1237 
Expiration Date: 07/31/2026

 • Initial Data Publication  
o Occurs annually on or by June 30.  
o The first publication of the eligible records submitted and attested on or before the 
submission closing date of the latest PY . 
o The republication of eligible records from prior PY s, including updates to records made 
since the previous publication.  
o The data published is the latest attested version of disputed and resolved payment 
records at the end of the correction period.  
• Refresh Publication  
o Occurs at least once annually, typically at the beginning of the calendar year.  
o Publishes updates to the data made since the initial publication.  
 Contains updates made to records after the correction period of the latest PY  and 
before the end of the calendar year (or before the modified-without-dispute 
cutoff date in November for records, not under dispute). 
o The data published is the latest attested version of the data at the end of the calendar 
year.  
CMS publishes the Open Payments data for publi c use at https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov .  
2.3.1  Effect of Disputes on Data Publication  
 
Disputes initiated within  the pre -publication review, and dispute period and resolved by the end 
of the correction period will be published and identified as non-disputed in the initial data 
publication.  If an initiated dispute is not resolved by the end of the correction period, the record 
will be published and identified as disputed.  Disputes initiated or resolved after  the full 60 -day 
review, dispute, and correction period are  not reflected in the initial data publication and will be 
published as original attested-to data. Those disputes and any related data changes will be published in the next publication which may be a refresh publication or the next PY data 
publication.  
 
The table below lists scenarios for dispute initiation and resolution and explains how  
records are identified in data publications based upon those scenarios.

Resolved: After the end of the calendar year No Yes 
 
 
Note: If a record was initially disputed during the Pre-Publication 45-day review and dispute period 
and more disputes are initiated on that same record during the 15-day correction period, then the 
data attested to as of the end of the 15-day correction period is published in the initial publication, 
including any changes made due to dispute resolution. 
2.4 Data Sources and Types  
Applicable manufacturers and applicable GPOs must enter detailed information about payments, other 
transfers of value, or investment interests into the CMS Open Payments system. These payments, other 
transfers of value, and ownership or investment interests are categorized into three (3) payment types: 
1. General Payments: Payments or other transfers of value made that are not in connection 
with a research agreement or research protocol. 
2. Research Payments: Payments or other transfers of value made in connection with a 
research agreement or research protocol. Open Payments Methodology Overview & Data Dictionary   OMB Control No: 0938 -1237 
Expiration Date: 07/31/2026  
 
11 
 3. Physician Ownership or Investment Interest Information: Information about physicians who 
hold an ownership or investment interest in an applicable manufacturer or applicable GPO or 
who have an immediate family member holding such interest. 
2.5 Reporting Limitations and Exclusions  
The Open Payments data published by CMS is subject to limitations and exclusions. 
Certain payments or other transfers of value are excluded from reporting, such as product samples and 
educational materials intended for patient use. Records of such payments and other transfers of value 
shoul d not be submitted to the Open Payments system. These exclusions are outlined in the Open 
Payments final rule, at 42 C.F.R. § 403.904(i), available at https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Law -
and-Policy.  
Payment records are only accepted by the Open Payments system if they are both successfully validated 
and successfully matched to a valid physician, NPP , or teaching hospital. 
2.6 Publication Rules  
The publication rules for Open Payments are as follows: 
• Eligible records submitted and attested before the end of the data submission period 
will be published in that year’s initial and data refresh publications. 
• The data published in the June (initial) publication is the latest attested version of the 
data at the end of the correction period. 
• The data published in the early year (refresh) publication is the latest attested version of 
the data at the end of the preceding calendar year (December 31) . 
Records may not be eligible for publication based upon publishing limitations. See Section 2.6.1 for 
details. 
2.6.1  Publishing Limitations  
The following limitations apply to what records are published: 
1. Data attested after the submission closing date is considered late and will not be included in the 
initial publication or the next data refresh publication. Late submissions may be eligible for 
publication in the following calendar year’s data publication.  
2. Records in which physician /NPP or principal investigator identifying information is changed 
after the submission end date will not be included in the initial publication or the next data 
refresh publication. Such a change requires the deletion of the original record and submission of 
a new corrected record; after the submission closing date, the corrected record would be a late 
submission.  
a. These corrected records may be eligible for publication in the following calendar year’s 
initial data publication.  Open Payments Methodology Overview & Data Dictionar y   OMB Control No: 0938 -1237 
Expiration Date: 07/31/2026

 3. Records deleted prior to the end of the correction period for that year will not be published in 
the initial data publication or in any subsequent publications.  
a. Records deleted after the correction period but prior to December 31 of that calendar 
year will be published in the initial publication but will be removed in the data refresh 
publication and any subsequent publications. 
4. R
ecords without disputes that are updated after the submission period will not be published in 
the initial data publication.  
a. The record may be eligible for the next data refresh publication if it was resubmitted and attested by the modified- without -dispute cutoff date in November of that year. 
b. Updates to undisputed records that are resubmitted and attested after the modified - 
without -dispute cutoff date in November will not be published in the subsequent refresh 
publication but may be eligible for publication in the following calendar year’s publication.  
5. Records that were  previously published and were edited after their publication  and not re -
attested by the end of the next correction period are not published. 
6. Reporting entities may request a delay in the publication of research payment record(s)  if the 
record (s) relate to research or development of a new drug, biological, device, or medical supply; 
a new application of an existing drug, biological, device, or medical supply; or clinical investigations regarding a new drug, biological, device, or medical supply. These payments will be 
published in later publications of Open Payments as appropriate. See the Open Payments Final 
Rule, 42 C.F.R. § 403.910, available at https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Law -and-Policy. 
a. Records for which submitters requested a delay in publication or a renewal of a delay in a 
publication prior to the end of the submission period will not be published for the year 
they are delayed. These records will be eligible for publication in the next year’s publication, unless the delay in publication is renewed.  
b. Records may be delayed up to four years from the year of the payment (i.e., the record’s PY). 
c. Records without disputes that are updated to remove the delay in publication after the 
submission period will not be published in the initial publication but will be published in the refresh publication.

Open Payments data can be viewed online and downloaded. 
3.1 Online Data Access 
The Open Payments data is accessible through the Open Payments Search Tool and the Open Payments 
Data Explorer . The Search Tool  (https://op enpay mentsdata.cms.gov/search) allows users to search Open 
Payments data for physicians, NPPs , teaching hospitals , and companies. The Data Explorer 
(https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/datasets ) allows users to browse PY datasetsand filter by reported 
record fields  
3.2 Downloading the Data  
CMS allows anyone  to download complete Open Payments data sets. Data sets for all PYs are available. 
The data sets are contained in downloadable ZIP files. Each PY ZIP file contains several comma-
delimited character-separated value (CSV) files and a README text file. The PY is included in each ZIP 
file’s name. 
Also available for download is a supplement file that contains detailed information about  
physicians/NPPs  indicated as recipients of payments, other transfers of value, or physicians as 
holding ownership or investment interests in applicable manufacturers on records that were published 
through the Open Payments program. The supplement file also contains information about principal 
investigators who were associated with research payments or other transfers of value in records 
published by CMS through the Open Payments program. The supplement file contains only 
physicians/NPPs  who have at least one payment record associated with them that has been published. 
This list is available in a downloadable ZIP file, which contains a comma-delimited character-separated 
value (CSV) file and a README text file. 
Programs recommended for file decompression are WinZip, WinRAR, and 7-Zip. CMS does not 
recommend using Windo ws File Compression to decompress downloaded files. 
The Program Year ZIP files contain CSV files of the following types: 
• General Payments Details 
o General payment records provide the total value of general payments or other transfers of 
value to a particular recipient for a particular date. 
o Each record includes identifying information for the applicable manufacturer or applicable 
GPO who made the payment and identifying information for the recipient.

being published for the first time. 
CHANGED The payment record has been published in a previous 
publication and has been modified since its last 
publication, which may include an update to its dispute 
status. 
UNCHANGED The payment record has been  published in the previous 
publication and is being republished without  change in 
the current publication. 
• Deleted and Removed Records –  The Deleted Records File contains the Record ID, Payment Type, 
and PY of records that were previously published and have been deleted or removed from the 
Open Payments system for that PY . Each record also has a Change Type indicator, which shows if 
the record was deleted or removed.  
o The initial publication of the latest PY ’s data will not include a Deleted and Removed 
Record file, as the initial publication contains records that have not been deleted or 
removed.  
o In the event , there are no REMOVED or DELETED records for a PY, the Removed and 
Deleted Records file will not be included in the compressed (.zip) file.

 deleted without providing a reason for deletion. Records that are deleted and 
resubmitted must also be linked when resubmitting using the Record ID.  
The text file in the PY ZIP files is: 
• README  - A text file that provides information about the files available for download, their 
formats, special handling considerations, and other alternatives for viewing the Open Payments 
data.  
Also available for download is the Covered Recipient Profile S upplement  Detail ZIP file, which contains 
one (1) CSV file and one (1) README file. The CSV file contains all of the identifying information for 
physicians and NPPs  who were indicated as recipients of payments, other transfers of value, or
