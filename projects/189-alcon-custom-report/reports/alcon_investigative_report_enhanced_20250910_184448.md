## Appendix: Methodology

# Appendix: Methodology and Data Lineage

## Methodology

This analysis examines financial relationships between Alcon Laboratories and healthcare providers using data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Open Payments database. The analysis focuses exclusively on pharmaceutical products, deliberately excluding medical device payments to provide focused insights into drug-related financial relationships.

### Data Sources

- **Open Payments Database**: CMS Open Payments general payments data
- **Table**: `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_data_projects.op_general_all_aggregate_static_optimized`
- **Payment Records**: 65,938 transactions
- **Unique Providers**: 17,722 NPIs
- **Total Payment Value**: $29,703,057.51

### Inclusion Criteria

Payments were included based on:
1. Manufacturer name containing "Alcon" (case-insensitive)
2. Drug products identified through comprehensive classification:
   - Systane (Lubricant Eye Drop)
   - EYSUVIS (Dry Eye Medication)
   - Rocklatan (Glaucoma Medication)
   - Azopt (Glaucoma Medication)
   - Simbrinza (Glaucoma Medication)
   - Rhopressa (Glaucoma Medication)
   - Pataday (Allergy Medication)
   - Records with NULL or empty drug names (potentially drug-related)

### Analytical Methods

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary metrics for payment volumes, distributions, and patterns
2. **Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor assessment incorporating payment volume, frequency, and maximum values
3. **Categorical Analysis**: Segmentation by drug product, payment nature, and provider characteristics
4. **Concentration Analysis**: Assessment of payment concentration among provider cohorts

### Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings:

1. **Temporal Constraints**: Analysis limited to available data periods
2. **Product Attribution**: Significant portion of payments lack specific product designation
3. **Clinical Context**: Analysis cannot account for clinical appropriateness or patient factors
4. **Causal Inference**: Statistical associations do not establish causation
5. **Scope Limitations**: Focus on drug products excludes device-related relationships

## Data Processing Pipeline

- **Extraction Date**: 2025-09-10
- **Processing Duration**: Automated extraction and analysis
- **Quality Checks**: Data validation for NPI formats and payment values
- **Deduplication**: Distinct provider identification through NPI matching

## Important Disclaimer

This analysis identifies statistical patterns and associations within the payment data. These findings do not establish causation between payments and clinical decisions. Multiple factors influence prescribing patterns including:

- Clinical evidence and guidelines
- Patient characteristics and preferences
- Formulary requirements and insurance coverage
- Disease severity and treatment history
- Regional practice patterns
- Continuing medical education requirements

All identified relationships should be evaluated within appropriate clinical, regulatory, and ethical contexts. The analysis is intended to promote transparency and inform stakeholder discussions about industry-provider relationships in healthcare.
