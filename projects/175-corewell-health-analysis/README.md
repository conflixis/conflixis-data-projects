## Objectives
- Analyze Corewell Health provider data (14,175 unique NPIs)
- Identify pharmaceutical payment influence patterns
- Assess vulnerability of NPs and PAs to payment influence
- Generate comprehensive analysis report and actionable insights

## Key Findings
- **$49.4 million** in payment-attributable prescriptions from $5.4M in payments
- **9.20x ROI** - 420% higher than national average
- **71.8x ROI for PAs** - extreme vulnerability in mid-level providers
- **23 high-risk providers** with >30% attribution rates

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis report (corewell_health_deep_dive_analysis.md)
- BigQuery NPI table (corewell_health_npis)
- Python analysis scripts for reproducibility
- CSV data exports with detailed metrics
