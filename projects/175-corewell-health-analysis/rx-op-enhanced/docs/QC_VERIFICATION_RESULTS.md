## Key Findings

### Data Accuracy

2. **Attribution rates are accurate within 0.02%** - Minor rounding differences are negligible
3. **High-risk provider identification is accurate** - Both count and individual cases verified

### Methodology Notes
1. **Provider Type Grouping**: The analysis correctly groups provider types using `PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW.ROLE_NAME`:
   - Physicians include both "Physician" and "Hospitalist" roles
   - Nurse Practitioners include NP, Certified Nurse Midwife, and Clinical Nurse Specialist roles
   - Physician Assistants are a single category

2. **Time Period**: All metrics are correctly filtered for 2021-2022 period

3. **Data Sources**:
   - Corewell NPIs: `data-analytics-389803.temp.corewell_provider_npis` (14,175 total NPIs)
   - Attribution data: `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full`
   - Provider types: `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW`

### National Comparison Context
The report states the national average ROI is 1.77x, making Corewell's 9.20x ROI approximately 5.2x higher than typical. This claim should be verified against the source of the national average figure.

## Recommendations

1. **No corrections needed** - The report numbers are accurate
2. **Consider adding footnotes** about:
   - The specific provider type groupings used
   - The source of the national average ROI comparison
   - The methodology for calculating attribution percentages

3. **Data quality note**: The extreme ROI for Physician Assistants (71.42x) is accurate but warrants investigation into:
   - Sample size effects (664 paid PAs)
   - Specific drug categories driving this ROI
   - Geographic or institutional factors
