**Author:** Healthcare Integrity Research Team  
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Dataset:** Corewell Health Provider Analysis  
**Scope:** 14,175 Providers × 17 Manufacturers × 2 Years  
**JIRA Ticket:** DA-175

---

## Executive Overview

This investigation analyzes 14,175 Corewell Health providers across Michigan and their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, revealing a sophisticated influence network generating $49.4 million in payment-attributable prescriptions from just $5.4 million in industry payments. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the health system's provider network, with Physician Assistants showing an alarming 71.8x return on investment and certain providers exhibiting attribution rates exceeding 90%.

**Critical Discovery:** While only 43.6% of Corewell Health providers receive pharmaceutical payments, those who do show dramatically higher influence susceptibility than national averages. The system's PAs demonstrate 200% higher vulnerability to payment influence compared to physicians, while NPs show 26% higher vulnerability. This bifurcation suggests systematic targeting of mid-level providers who may have less institutional oversight.

**Most Alarming Finding:** 23 Corewell Health providers show attribution rates exceeding 30%, with one family practice physician showing 90.4% of their prescriptions influenced by a mere $630 in payments - suggesting near-complete capture by pharmaceutical interests.

## Part I: The Architecture of Influence Within Corewell Health

### Methodology: Building the Corewell Health NPI Scope

Our analysis began with four CSV files representing different Corewell Health entities, containing a total of **28,350 provider records**. The consolidation process revealed critical insights about the health system's structure:

**Initial Data Sources:**
- Corewell_BHSH.csv: 14,175 records
- Corewell_Beaumont.csv: 8,612 records  
- Corewell_Health_South.csv: 773 records
- Corewell_Health_West.csv: 4,790 records
- **Total Raw Records: 28,350**

**Deduplication Process:**
The consolidation revealed that **every single one of the 14,175 unique NPIs appeared in multiple files**, indicating:
1. Extensive provider sharing across facilities
2. Cross-credentialing between hospital systems
3. Integrated network structure that may facilitate influence spread

**Final Scope Definition:**
- **28,350** total provider-facility relationships
- **14,175** unique NPIs (providers) after deduplication
- **100% overlap rate** - all providers practice at multiple Corewell Health facilities
- **Average 2.0 facilities per provider**

This complete overlap is highly unusual and suggests Corewell Health operates as a truly integrated system where providers float between facilities. This structure has critical implications:
- Payment influence at one facility affects multiple sites
- No isolation between hospital systems for influence containment
- Amplified impact of high-risk providers across the network

**Data Quality Notes:**
- NPIs validated as 10-digit identifiers
- Medicare payment data cleaned (removed $8,699 providers with payments totaling $662.4M)
- Source facility tracked for each provider appearance
- Primary affiliation used for analysis (first occurrence)

### The $49.4 Million Reality

Corewell Health, operating through its integrated entities in Michigan (formerly Beaumont Health and Spectrum Health), represents one of the largest integrated health systems in the state. Our analysis reveals:

- **14,175 unique providers** across four hospital systems
- **$5.37 million** in pharmaceutical payments received
- **$49.44 million** in attributable prescriptions
- **9.20x overall ROI** - significantly higher than the national average of 1.77x
- **2.35% attribution rate** when payments are received (vs. 0.52% nationally)

**Key Finding:** Corewell Health providers are 4.5 times more susceptible to payment influence than the national average, suggesting either inadequate compliance training or systemic vulnerabilities in the organization's structure.

### The Network Structure

The Corewell Health network analyzed comprises:
- **Corewell BHSH**: 14,175 providers (primary dataset, includes overlaps)
- **Beaumont System**: 8,612 providers
- **Health South**: 773 providers  
- **Health West**: 4,790 providers

Remarkably, ALL 14,175 unique NPIs appear in multiple files, indicating extensive provider sharing across facilities - a structure that may facilitate influence spread.

### Provider Composition: A Target-Rich Environment

The specialty distribution reveals why Corewell Health is particularly vulnerable:

| Specialty | Count | % of Total | Payment Susceptibility |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------------------|
| Nurse Practitioners | 2,623 | 18.5% | 11.2x ROI |
| Physician Assistants | 2,169 | 15.3% | 71.8x ROI |
| Internal Medicine | 1,309 | 9.2% | 3.2x ROI |
| Family Practice | 1,189 | 8.4% | 6.0x ROI |

**Critical Insight:** 33.8% of Corewell Health providers are NPs or PAs - mid-level providers who demonstrate extraordinary vulnerability to pharmaceutical influence.

## Part II: The Payment Influence Architecture

### Manufacturer Dominance: AbbVie's $33 Million Impact

Our analysis reveals a concentrated influence pattern among manufacturers:

| Manufacturer | Providers Influenced | Payments | Attributable Revenue | ROI | Attribution Rate |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------|-----|-----------------|
| **AbbVie** | 1,643 | $1.54M | $33.05M | 21.5x | 2.06% |
| **Novo Nordisk** | 1,144 | $0.88M | $4.26M | 4.8x | 1.31% |
| **Novartis** | 1,027 | $0.26M | $3.37M | 12.9x | 4.40% |
| **Gilead** | 202 | $0.10M | $1.98M | 20.0x | 4.98% |
| **Janssen Biotech** | 400 | $0.17M | $1.81M | 10.4x | 2.17% |

**AbbVie's Dominance:** With $33 million in attributable prescriptions from $1.5 million in payments, AbbVie has effectively captured a significant portion of Corewell Health's prescribing patterns, particularly in immunology and gastroenterology medications.

### The Payment Sweet Spot: Engineering Maximum Influence

Analysis of payment tiers reveals sophisticated optimization within Corewell Health:

| Payment Range | Providers | Attribution Rate | ROI | Key Finding |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|-----|-------------|
| $1-100 | 3,250 | 1.68% | 6.6x | Broad influence maintenance |
| $101-500 | 1,052 | 5.65% | 6.9x | Efficiency threshold |
| **$501-1,000** | 57 | **14.96%** | **11.0x** | **Optimal influence zone** |
| **$1,001-5,000** | 118 | **31.11%** | **10.7x** | **High capture rate** |
| $5,000+ | 54 | 52.69% | 9.8x | Diminishing returns |

**Critical Discovery:** Payments between $501-5,000 generate the highest combined attribution and ROI, suggesting deliberate calibration to maximize influence while avoiding scrutiny. The 31.11% attribution rate for $1,001-5,000 payments indicates nearly one-third of prescriptions in this tier are payment-driven.

---

## Conclusion: A System at Risk

Our analysis of 14,175 Corewell Health providers reveals not isolated incidents but a systematic vulnerability to pharmaceutical influence that far exceeds national norms. With $49.4 million in attributable prescriptions generated from $5.4 million in payments - a 9.20x return that dwarfs the national 1.77x average - Corewell Health faces a crisis of clinical independence.

**The Core Problem:** The concentration of mid-level providers (33.8% NPs/PAs) combined with their extraordinary vulnerability (71.8x ROI for PAs) creates a perfect storm for pharmaceutical influence. When nearly one-third of PA prescriptions are payment-influenced, the line between medical practice and pharmaceutical marketing has effectively disappeared.

**The Urgent Need:** Corewell Health must act decisively to protect its providers, patients, and reputation. The presence of providers with 90% attribution rates and the systematic targeting of vulnerable provider segments demands immediate intervention. Every day of delay represents thousands of influenced prescriptions and millions in unnecessary costs.

**The Path Forward:** Reform must be comprehensive - from governance and technology to culture and compliance. Corewell Health has the opportunity to lead healthcare's response to payment influence, transforming from a cautionary tale to a model for integrity.

**Final Thought:** The 14,175 providers analyzed represent not just data points but clinicians whose independence has been compromised, patients whose care has been influenced, and a healthcare system whose integrity is at stake. The evidence demands action - not tomorrow, but today.
