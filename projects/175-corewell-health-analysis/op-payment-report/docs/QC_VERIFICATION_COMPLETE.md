# QC Verification Complete - Open Payments Report

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - Critical errors found in all major claims

## Executive Summary

The Open Payments Report contains systematic calculation errors across ALL extreme correlation claims. Every drug tested showed massive overstatement (13x to 132x inflation). Additionally, the correlations are largely explained by specialty selection bias rather than payment influence.

## Verification Results

### Drug Correlation Claims vs Reality

| Drug | Report Claim | Actual Ratio | Overstatement | Sample Size | Key Finding |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Krystexxa** | 426x | 3.2x | **132x inflated** | 10 vs 5 | 60% rheumatologists in payment group vs 0% |
| **Enbrel** | 218x | 5.0x | **44x inflated** | 90 vs 212 | Rheumatologists 7.2x overrepresented |
| **Trelegy** | 115x | 8.8x | **13x inflated** | 1146 vs 7510 | Pulmonologists 4.0x overrepresented |
| **Xarelto** | 114x | 4.9x | **23x inflated** | 910 vs 4610 | Cardiologists 5.0x overrepresented |
| **Ozempic** | 92x | 3.5x | **26x inflated** | 1208 vs 2928 | Endocrinologists 4.6x overrepresented |

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Calculation Error Pattern**: Systematic multiplication errors in aggregation
2. **Specialty Selection Bias**: Companies target specialists who already prescribe their drugs
3. **No Statistical Controls**: No adjustment for confounding variables
4. **Sample Size Issues**: Some comparisons based on tiny samples (Krystexxa: n=15)

### Specialty Bias Evidence

For each drug, the specialists who naturally prescribe it most are overrepresented in the payment group:

- **Krystexxa**: Rheumatologists prescribe 5.3x more naturally, comprise 60% of payment group vs 0% of non-payment
- **Enbrel**: Rheumatologists 7.2x overrepresented in payment recipients
- **Trelegy**: Pulmonologists 4.0x overrepresented in payment recipients  
- **Xarelto**: Cardiologists 5.0x overrepresented in payment recipients
- **Ozempic**: Endocrinologists 4.6x overrepresented in payment recipients

## Critical Finding

**The apparent "payment influence" largely disappears when accounting for medical specialty.** Companies target specialists who already prescribe their drugs, creating a spurious correlation that the report misinterprets as causation.

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Priority 1)
✅ Re-calculated all extreme correlations  
✅ Identified specialty bias as confounding factor  
⏳ Fix all incorrect numbers in report  
⏳ Change language from causation to correlation  
⏳ Add sample size warnings

### Within 1 Week (Priority 2)
- Add confidence intervals
- Create limitations section
- Document methodology
- Implement peer review

### Within 2 Weeks (Priority 3)
- Fix SQL queries for case sensitivity
- Create reproducible analysis scripts
- Establish QC checkpoints

## QC Checklist Status

- [x] Basic payment metrics verified ($86.9M total)
- [x] Basic prescription metrics verified (10,424 providers)
- [x] Krystexxa correlation re-calculated (3.2x not 426x)
- [x] Enbrel correlation re-calculated (5.0x not 218x)
- [x] Trelegy correlation re-calculated (8.8x not 115x)
- [x] Xarelto correlation re-calculated (4.9x not 114x)
- [x] Ozempic correlation re-calculated (3.5x not 92x)
- [x] Specialty bias analysis completed
- [ ] Report corrections implemented
- [ ] Statistical controls added
- [ ] Peer review completed

## Recommendation

**DO NOT DISTRIBUTE** this report until all corrections are made. The errors are so severe they could lead to:
- Regulatory scrutiny
- Legal liability
- Complete loss of credibility
- Potential lawsuits from pharmaceutical companies

The report requires a complete rewrite of Section 3 (Payment-Prescription Correlations) with accurate numbers and proper statistical controls.
