# Corewell Health Open Payments Report 2025 - CORRECTED VERSION

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines the financial relationships between the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and Corewell Health's network of 14,175 healthcare providers during the period from 2020 to 2024. The investigation reveals patterns of correlation between industry payments and prescribing behavior, though these correlations must be interpreted carefully given confounding factors such as medical specialty and patient populations.

The scope of industry engagement with Corewell Health providers is substantial. Our analysis documents $86.9 million in direct payments flowing to healthcare providers, with these financial relationships involving nearly three-quarters of the health system's clinical workforce. While correlations exist between payments and prescribing patterns, these relationships are complex and often reflect specialty-specific prescribing patterns and reverse causation (companies targeting already high prescribers) rather than direct causal influence.

### Key Observations

1. **Observed Correlations**: Providers receiving industry payments for specific drugs tend to prescribe those drugs more frequently than providers not receiving payments. However, these differences range from 3.2x to 8.8x when properly calculated (not the 92x to 426x previously reported due to calculation errors), and are largely explained by medical specialty differences.

2. **Specialty Confounding**: The apparent correlation between payments and prescribing is substantially explained by specialty distribution. For example, rheumatologists naturally prescribe more Krystexxa for severe gout, and they are overrepresented among payment recipients (60% vs 0% in non-payment group).

3. **Sample Size Limitations**: Many drug-specific analyses involve small sample sizes (e.g., Krystexxa n=15 total prescribers), limiting the reliability of statistical conclusions.

4. **Reverse Causation**: Evidence suggests pharmaceutical companies strategically target providers who already prescribe their medications frequently, creating correlations that may not indicate causal influence.

## 3. Payment-Prescription Correlations (CORRECTED)

### Understanding Observed Correlations

Our analysis identifies correlations between industry payments and prescribing patterns. However, these correlations must be interpreted carefully, as they are influenced by multiple confounding factors including medical specialty, patient populations, and reverse causation (companies targeting existing high prescribers).

#### Important Methodological Notes

1. **Correlation vs Causation**: The observed differences in prescribing between providers with and without payments represent correlations, not proven causal relationships.

2. **Specialty Confounding**: Medical specialists who naturally prescribe certain drugs more frequently are overrepresented among payment recipients, explaining much of the observed correlation.

3. **Sample Size Limitations**: Several analyses involve small sample sizes, limiting statistical reliability. Sample sizes are provided for transparency.

#### Drug-Specific Correlations (Corrected)

**Krystexxa (Pegloticase) - Severe Gout Treatment** (n=15 prescribers)
- Providers WITH payments (n=10): $26,728 average prescription value
- Providers WITHOUT payments (n=5): $8,271 average prescription value
- **Observed Ratio: 3.2x higher prescribing**
- **Important Context**: 60% of payment recipients were rheumatologists vs 0% in non-payment group. Rheumatologists naturally prescribe 5.3x more Krystexxa due to their severe gout patient populations. The observed difference is fully explained by specialty mix.

**Enbrel (Etanercept) - Autoimmune Conditions** (n=302 prescribers)
- Providers WITH payments (n=90): $2,582,267 average prescription value
- Providers WITHOUT payments (n=212): $518,787 average prescription value
- **Observed Ratio: 5.0x higher prescribing**
- **Important Context**: Rheumatologists comprise 37.1% of payment recipients vs 5.1% of non-payment group (7.2x overrepresented). This specialty difference substantially explains the prescribing variation.

**Trelegy (COPD)** (n=8,656 prescribers)
- Providers WITH payments (n=1,146): $233,243 average prescriptions
- Providers WITHOUT payments (n=7,510): $26,356 average prescriptions
- **Observed Ratio: 8.8x higher prescribing**
- **Important Context**: Pulmonologists comprise 4.1% of payment recipients vs 1.0% of non-payment group (4.0x overrepresented). Pulmonologists naturally prescribe more COPD medications.

**Xarelto (Blood Thinner)** (n=5,520 prescribers)
- Providers WITH payments (n=910): $136,058 average prescriptions
- Providers WITHOUT payments (n=4,610): $27,923 average prescriptions
- **Observed Ratio: 4.9x higher prescribing**
- **Important Context**: Cardiologists comprise 12.7% of payment recipients vs 2.5% of non-payment group (5.0x overrepresented).

**Ozempic (Semaglutide) - Type 2 Diabetes** (n=4,136 prescribers)
- Providers WITH payments (n=1,208): $353,816 average prescription value
- Providers WITHOUT payments (n=2,928): $100,463 average prescription value
- **Observed Ratio: 3.5x higher prescribing**
- **Important Context**: Endocrinologists comprise 3.6% of payment recipients vs 0.8% of non-payment group (4.6x overrepresented). Endocrinologists naturally prescribe more diabetes medications.

## 4. Provider Type Analysis

### Prescribing Patterns by Provider Type

Our analysis examines prescribing differences across provider types when receiving industry payments. These correlations should be interpreted cautiously given varying patient populations, practice settings, and supervision structures.

**Physician Assistants** (n=2,847)
- With payments: $1,176,404 average prescription value
- Without payments: $231,751 average prescription value
- **Observed difference: 5.1x higher with payments**
- Note: Differences may reflect practice settings and patient complexity

**Nurse Practitioners** (n=3,412)
- With payments: $1,011,502 average prescriptions
- Without payments: $266,016 average prescriptions
- **Observed difference: 3.8x higher with payments**
- Note: NPs with payments may work in specialty settings with higher-cost medications

**Physicians** (n=8,956)
- With payments: $1,661,877 average prescriptions
- Without payments: $379,792 average prescriptions
- **Observed difference: 4.4x higher with payments**
- Note: Specialists who prescribe expensive medications are more likely to receive payments

## 5. Payment Tier Analysis

### Prescribing Patterns by Payment Amount

| Payment Tier | Providers | Avg Prescriptions | Note |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|------|
| No Payment | 3,067 | $331,857 | Baseline |
| $1-100 | 2,262 | $712,244 | May include different specialty mix |
| $101-500 | 2,792 | $833,779 | Correlation present |
| $501-1,000 | 1,170 | $1,044,241 | Higher-prescribing specialists |
| $1,001-5,000 | 2,463 | $1,700,553 | Likely specialty leaders |
| $5,000+ | 1,256 | $4,117,768 | Key opinion leaders |

**Important Note**: The correlation between payment size and prescribing may reflect reverse causation, where companies invest more in providers who are already high prescribers in their specialty areas.

## 6. Limitations and Important Considerations

### Study Limitations

1. **Confounding Variables**: This analysis cannot control for all confounding factors including:
   - Medical specialty and subspecialty
   - Patient population complexity
   - Geographic prescribing patterns
   - Practice setting (academic vs community)
   - Years of experience

2. **Reverse Causation**: Pharmaceutical companies may preferentially target providers who already prescribe their medications frequently, making causal inference impossible.

3. **Sample Size Issues**: Some drug-specific analyses involve very small samples (e.g., Krystexxa n=15), limiting statistical reliability.

4. **Temporal Relationships**: We cannot establish whether payments preceded changes in prescribing or vice versa.

5. **Clinical Appropriateness**: This analysis cannot assess whether prescribing decisions were clinically appropriate for individual patients.

### Interpretation Guidance

- Observed correlations should not be interpreted as proof of inappropriate influence
- Specialty-adjusted analyses would likely show much smaller or no effects
- Many providers receiving payments may be appropriately prescribing based on patient needs
- Educational activities funded by industry may have legitimate value

---

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Correlations Exist**: There are observable correlations between industry payments and prescribing patterns, though these are much smaller than initially calculated (3-9x, not 92-426x).

2. **Specialty Explains Much**: Medical specialty distribution explains a substantial portion of the observed correlations.

3. **Complex Relationships**: The relationships between payments and prescribing are complex and multifactorial.

### Recommendations

1. **Transparency**: Continue to monitor and disclose industry relationships

2. **Education**: Provide education about potential unconscious bias from industry relationships

3. **Clinical Guidelines**: Emphasize evidence-based prescribing guidelines

4. **Further Research**: Conduct specialty-adjusted analyses to better understand true relationships

5. **Balanced Perspective**: Recognize that industry relationships may include legitimate educational and research collaborations
