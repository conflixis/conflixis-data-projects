# QC Validation Report - Corewell Health Open Payments Analysis
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Generated by:** qc_validate_metrics.py

## Executive Summary

Quality control validation has identified **critical discrepancies** in the drug influence factors and provider vulnerability metrics reported in the Corewell Health Open Payments Report. While overall payment metrics and yearly trends are accurate, the influence calculations require immediate correction.

## Validation Results

### ✓ PASSED: Overall Metrics
All overall metrics match the report claims exactly:
- **Unique Providers:** 10,424 (✓ matches report)
- **Total Transactions:** 638,567 (✓ matches report)  
- **Total Payments:** $86,873,248 (✓ matches report)
- **Coverage:** 73.5% of 14,174 Corewell providers (✓ matches report)

### ✓ PASSED: Yearly Provider Counts
After fixing the GROUP BY error in 01_analyze_op_payments.py, yearly counts now match:

| Year | Actual Providers | Report Claims | Status |
|------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| 2020 | 3,405 | 3,405 | ✓ MATCH |
| 2021 | 5,632 | 5,632 | ✓ MATCH |
| 2022 | 6,678 | 6,678 | ✓ MATCH |
| 2023 | 7,463 | 7,463 | ✓ MATCH |
| 2024 | 8,026 | 8,026 | ✓ MATCH |

### ✗ CRITICAL FAILURE: Drug Influence Factors

The drug influence factors are **massively overstated** in the report:

| Drug | Report Claims | Actual Factor | Accuracy | Overstatement |
|------|--------------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **KRYSTEXXA** | 426x | 1.2x | 0.3% | 355x overstated |
| **OZEMPIC** | 92x | 2.3x | 2.5% | 40x overstated |
| **ENBREL** | 218x | 14.4x | 6.6% | 15x overstated |

#### Analysis Details:
- **KRYSTEXXA:** Providers with payments prescribe 13.4 scripts/year vs 11.0 for those without (1.2x factor, not 426x)
- **OZEMPIC:** 237.4 scripts with payments vs 105.3 without (2.3x factor, not 92x)
- **ENBREL:** 248.3 scripts with payments vs 17.2 without (14.4x factor, not 218x)

### ✗ FAILURE: Provider Type Vulnerability

Provider vulnerability percentages are significantly incorrect:

| Provider Type | Report Claims | Actual Increase | Difference |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **PA** | 407.6% | 99.1% | -308.5 points |
| **NP** | Not reported | 113.3% | N/A |
| **Physician** | Not reported | 159.2% | N/A |

#### Analysis Details:
- **PAs:** With payments prescribe 12,980 scripts vs 6,518 without (99% increase, not 408%)
- **NPs:** With payments prescribe 11,606 scripts vs 5,440 without (113% increase)
- **Physicians:** With payments prescribe 17,604 scripts vs 6,791 without (159% increase)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Drug Influence Factor Error
The error appears to be in script 03_payment_influence_analysis.py. The calculation is likely:
- Using total prescriptions instead of averages per provider
- Comparing wrong cohorts (e.g., all providers vs subset)
- Mathematical error in the influence factor formula

### 2. Provider Type Vulnerability Error  
Similar calculation error in the provider vulnerability analysis, likely in the same script.

## Required Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Critical):
1. **Fix 03_payment_influence_analysis.py** to correctly calculate influence factors
2. **Update report** to reflect actual influence factors:
   - Krystexxa: Change from 426x to 1.2x
   - Ozempic: Change from 92x to 2.3x  
   - Enbrel: Change from 218x to 14.4x
3. **Recalculate** provider type vulnerability metrics
4. **Update narrative** to reflect more modest but still significant influence

### RECOMMENDED:
1. Add validation checks to analysis scripts to catch calculation errors
2. Implement unit tests for critical calculations
3. Create a standard QC checklist for all future reports

## Impact Assessment

The overstated influence factors significantly impact the report's credibility:
- **Legal Risk:** Potential defamation if manufacturers dispute claims
- **Credibility Risk:** Undermines trust in all findings
- **Regulatory Risk:** May trigger scrutiny of methodology

## Validation Script Output

```
OVERALL METRICS: ✓ All metrics validated
YEARLY TRENDS: ✓ All years validated after fix
DRUG INFLUENCE: ✗ Massive overstatement (0.3%-6.6% of claimed values)
PROVIDER TYPE: ✗ PA vulnerability overstated by 309%
```

## Conclusion

While the payment data itself is accurate, the derived influence metrics contain critical errors that must be corrected immediately before report distribution. The actual influence factors, while much smaller than claimed, still show meaningful patterns that support the report's overall conclusions about payment influence on prescribing behavior.
