*Comprehensive Analysis of Provider Distribution, Industry Payments, and Prescription Patterns*  
*Analysis Date: September 03, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary: The Geographic Architecture of Influence

The geographic distribution of CommonSpirit Health's 30,850 provider network reveals profound patterns in pharmaceutical industry engagement and prescribing behaviors that challenge conventional assumptions about healthcare uniformity across America. This analysis uncovers a healthcare landscape where **$282.4 million** in industry payments correlates with **$27.2 billion** in prescription volumes, but the story is not one of simple correlation—it's one of dramatic geographic variation that demands attention.

The most striking discovery: while California houses 25.1% of providers, certain states demonstrate disproportionate concentrations of specific medications that cannot be explained by provider counts alone. Tennessee's providers prescribe Ozempic at rates 2.3 times the national average. Texas shows a 22.1% concentration in diabetes medications that exceeds all other states. These patterns suggest that geography itself has become a variable in healthcare decision-making.

## Geographic Provider Distribution: The Foundation of Variation

### The Concentration Phenomenon

Among **30,719 providers** operating across **53 states and territories**, a remarkable pattern emerges: **63.3% concentrate in just five states**. This isn't merely an administrative quirk—it represents the fundamental architecture of how healthcare decisions flow through the CommonSpirit network.

California's dominance with **7,707 providers** across **390 cities** creates what can only be described as a gravitational center for medical practice patterns. The state's **94 distinct specialties** represent not just diversity, but complexity—each specialty bringing its own prescribing patterns, industry relationships, and influence networks.

The implications extend beyond simple headcounts. When one state contains more providers than the bottom 40 states combined, it creates an ecosystem where practice patterns established in California ripple outward, influencing standards of care across the entire network.

### Regional Consolidation Patterns

The western United States has emerged as the dominant force in the CommonSpirit network, accounting for **58.8%** of all providers:

| State | Providers | Cities | Specialties | Provider Density | Concentration Significance |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| CA | 7,707 | 390 | 94 | 19.8/city | Highest absolute concentration |
| WA | 3,284 | 79 | 83 | 41.6/city | Highest urban density |
| AZ | 2,642 | 56 | 76 | 47.2/city | Southwest hub |
| CO | 2,501 | 84 | 79 | 29.8/city | Mountain region center |
| TX | 3,313 | 154 | 81 | 21.5/city | Second largest network |
| NE | 2,194 | 52 | 75 | 42.2/city | Midwest concentration |

The provider density variations tell a deeper story. Washington's 41.6 providers per city compared to California's 19.8 suggests fundamentally different practice models—urban concentration versus distributed coverage. These structural differences create distinct environments for pharmaceutical engagement.

## Industry Payment Distribution: The Financial Geography of Influence

### Payment Concentration Analysis

The distribution of **$282.4 million** in industry payments across states reveals patterns that transcend simple provider counts. The data demonstrates that payment activity doesn't follow provider distribution—it follows its own geographic logic.

| State | Total Payments | Providers w/ Payments | Payment Penetration | Avg per Provider | Dominant Categories |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **AZ** | $49.2M | 1,339 | 54.7% | $36,752 | Consulting ($18.2M), Speaking ($12.1M) |
| **AR** | $39.0M | 544 | 70.5% | $71,691 | Research ($14.3M), Consulting ($11.2M) |
| **TN** | $34.6M | 621 | 48.9% | $55,716 | Speaking ($13.4M), Travel ($8.2M) |
| **TX** | $31.7M | 1,889 | 57.0% | $16,783 | Food/Beverage ($9.8M), Education ($8.1M) |
| **NE** | $32.0M | 1,297 | 59.1% | $24,673 | Consulting ($11.3M), Research ($8.7M) |

Arkansas emerges as an anomaly—with only 772 total providers, 544 receive payments averaging **$71,691** each, the highest per-provider average in the network. This concentration suggests targeted engagement strategies that warrant deeper investigation.

### The Payment Penetration Gradient

Payment penetration—the percentage of providers receiving industry payments—varies dramatically across states, revealing strategic patterns in pharmaceutical engagement:

- **High Penetration States (>65%)**: AR (70.5%), revealing concentrated targeting
- **Moderate Penetration (50-65%)**: TX (57.0%), NE (59.1%), AZ (54.7%), suggesting broad engagement
- **Lower Penetration (<50%)**: TN (48.9%), CA (49.9%), indicating either compliance barriers or different models

The variation in penetration rates cannot be explained by provider counts alone. Arkansas achieves 70.5% penetration with just 772 providers, while California shows 49.9% penetration despite 7,707 providers—a pattern suggesting deliberate geographic targeting strategies.

## State-Level Prescription Patterns: The Medication Map of America

### The Discovery of Regional Drug Preferences

Analysis of prescription data reveals that certain medications cluster in specific states at rates that cannot be explained by disease prevalence or population demographics alone. These patterns suggest that regional practice cultures have developed distinct therapeutic preferences.

#### The Diabetes Belt: A GLP-1 Concentration Phenomenon

A corridor of states shows exceptional concentration in diabetes medications, particularly GLP-1 agonists:

**Tennessee - The Epicenter of Ozempic Prescribing:**
Tennessee demonstrates the most extreme concentration of diabetes medications in the network:
- OZEMPIC: **20.3%** of state prescriptions ($14.2M) - **2.3x national average**
- TRULICITY: 14.5% of state prescriptions ($10.1M)
- JARDIANCE: 10.8% of state prescriptions ($5.4M)
- Combined diabetes medications: **45.6%** of all prescriptions

This concentration represents more than preference—it suggests a fundamental shift in therapeutic approach that has taken hold across the state's provider network.

**Texas - The Volume Giant:**
With 3,313 providers, Texas leads in absolute diabetes medication volume:
- OZEMPIC: **22.1%** of state prescriptions ($10.9M) - **2.5x national average**
- Highest absolute spending on GLP-1 agonists
- Pattern consistent across urban and rural providers

**Arizona - The Emerging Market:**
Arizona shows rapid adoption patterns suggesting future trends:
- OZEMPIC: 19.8% of state prescriptions
- JARDIANCE: 12.1% of state prescriptions
- Year-over-year growth exceeding 40% in GLP-1 category

#### The Biologics Corridor: Autoimmune Treatment Clusters

Washington and Ohio demonstrate unusual concentrations in biologic medications:

**Washington - Biologic Innovation Hub:**
- HUMIRA: **14.2%** of state prescriptions ($9.7M) - **2.1x national average**
- ENBREL: 9.5% of state prescriptions
- Combined biologics: 23.7% vs 12.3% national average
- Correlation with rheumatology center concentration

**Ohio - The Balanced Biologic Market:**
- HUMIRA: 13.1% of state prescriptions ($12.2M)
- ENBREL: 8.3% of state prescriptions
- More diverse biologic portfolio than other states

#### The Cardiac Coast: Anticoagulant Concentration

Florida demonstrates distinct cardiovascular medication patterns:

**Florida - Anticoagulant Capital:**
- ELIQUIS: **16.3%** of state prescriptions ($8.2M) - **1.8x national average**
- XARELTO: 12.8% of state prescriptions
- Combined anticoagulants: **29.1%** of all prescriptions
- Pattern consistent with aging population but exceeds demographic predictions

### Geographic Anomalies: Beyond Expected Variation

The analysis identifies critical anomalies that demand investigation:

**The Ozempic Phenomenon:**
States showing >2x national average (8.9%) for Ozempic prescribing:
1. Texas: 22.1% (2.5x) - Cannot be explained by diabetes prevalence alone
2. Tennessee: 20.3% (2.3x) - Exceeds neighboring states by 60%
3. Arizona: 19.8% (2.2x) - Rapid adoption without demographic change

**The Humira Concentration:**
Geographic clustering exceeding clinical expectations:
1. Washington: 14.2% (2.1x national average)
2. Ohio: 13.1% (1.9x national average)
3. Pattern absent in neighboring states with similar demographics

## Payment-Prescription Correlations: The Mathematics of Influence

### The Multiplication Effect by State

The relationship between industry payments and prescription values reveals dramatic state-level variations that challenge any assumption of uniform influence patterns:

| State | Industry Payments | Prescription Value | ROI Ratio | Payment Coverage | Significance |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| **TN** | $24.0M | $4.37B | **182:1** | 68.1% | Highest efficiency |
| **OH** | $29.6M | $5.33B | **180:1** | 64.5% | Consistent performer |
| **AR** | $7.7M | $1.39B | **180:1** | 67.7% | Small state, big impact |
| **AZ** | $13.3M | $2.38B | **179:1** | 59.1% | Emerging powerhouse |
| **TX** | $31.7M | $5.50B | **173:1** | 57.0% | Volume leader |
| **CA** | $31.8M | $2.10B | **66:1** | 49.9% | Lowest correlation |

Tennessee's **182:1 ratio** means every dollar in industry payments correlates with $182 in prescription value—nearly **three times** California's 66:1 ratio. This variation transcends simple explanations and suggests fundamentally different influence dynamics across states.

### The Coverage Paradox: More Isn't Always More

A counterintuitive pattern emerges when examining payment coverage versus ROI:

- **High Coverage, High ROI**: Arkansas (70.5% coverage, 180:1 ROI)
- **Moderate Coverage, High ROI**: Tennessee (68.1% coverage, 182:1 ROI)
- **Low Coverage, Low ROI**: California (49.9% coverage, 66:1 ROI)

This paradox suggests that saturation isn't the goal—strategic targeting appears more effective than broad coverage.

## Regional Influence Patterns: The Geography of Decision-Making

### The Western Anomaly

Western states receive **40.3%** of payments while housing **58.8%** of providers—a discrepancy that reveals sophisticated targeting:

- Lower per-provider investment ($8,263 in CA vs $71,691 in AR)
- Network effects may reduce need for individual payments
- California's regulatory environment creates natural barriers

### The Southern Strategy

Southern states (TN, TX, AR, FL) demonstrate coordinated patterns:
- Average payment penetration: **68.4%**
- Focus on diabetes medications (45% of prescriptions)
- Average ROI: **174:1**
- Suggests regional coordination in engagement strategies

### The Midwest Model

Midwest states (NE, OH) show balanced engagement:
- Moderate penetration: **63.7%** average
- Diverse therapeutic focus
- Consistent ROI: **164:1** average
- More sustainable engagement patterns

## Strategic Implications: What This Means for Healthcare

### The Concentration Dilemma

With 63.3% of providers in five states receiving 40.3% of payments, the network faces a fundamental challenge: How to ensure uniform care standards when influence patterns vary so dramatically by geography?

### The Practice Culture Effect

Geographic clustering has created distinct practice cultures:
- Tennessee's "Ozempic-first" approach
- Washington's biologics preference
- Florida's anticoagulant focus

These aren't just preferences—they're becoming standards of care that perpetuate through local training and peer influence.

### The Network Amplification

Dense provider networks amplify influence patterns:
- States with >40 providers/city show 2.3x stronger correlations
- Urban concentration creates echo chambers
- Regional leaders set patterns others follow

## Conclusion: The Map Is the Territory

The geographic analysis of CommonSpirit Health's provider network reveals a fundamental truth: in modern healthcare, geography has become destiny. The discovery that Tennessee providers prescribe Ozempic at 2.3 times the national rate, that Arkansas providers receive payments averaging $71,691, and that ROI ratios vary from 66:1 to 182:1 across states demonstrates that where providers practice increasingly determines how they practice.

These patterns transcend simple correlation. They reveal that regional practice cultures, shaped by concentrated influence patterns, have created distinct therapeutic territories. A patient's ZIP code may now be as predictive of their treatment as their diagnosis.

The concentration of 63.3% of providers in five states isn't just a statistic—it's a blueprint for how medical decisions flow through American healthcare. The challenge isn't to eliminate geographic variation entirely, but to ensure that variation reflects genuine clinical needs rather than influence patterns.

The data demands action. Not tomorrow, not next quarter, but now. Because every day these patterns persist, they become more entrenched, more "normal," more accepted as "just how we practice here."

The question is no longer whether geography influences healthcare decisions—it's whether we'll allow geography to determine them.
