## Data-Driven Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement quarterly reviews for states with payment penetration >60% and ROI ratios >100:1
2. **Drug-Specific Analysis**: Investigate states showing 2x+ national average for high-cost medications
3. **Regional Coordination**: Establish western region task force for the 58.8% provider concentration

### Systematic Improvements

1. **State-Level Dashboards**: Deploy real-time monitoring for payment and prescription correlations
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement automated alerts for unusual state-drug combinations
3. **Comparative Benchmarking**: Establish state-specific thresholds based on regional patterns
