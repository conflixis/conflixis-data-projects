payment_overview:
  data_required:
    - overall_metrics
    - yearly_trends
    - payment_categories
    - top_manufacturers
  context: "Section 1: The Landscape of Industry Financial Relationships"
  prompt: |
    Analyze the payment data and write "The Landscape of Industry Financial Relationships" section.
    
    Data provided:
    {data}
    
    Structure your narrative around:
    1. Overall metrics narrative - interpret what X providers receiving $Y means
    2. Temporal evolution - explain the year-over-year growth pattern and what it suggests
    3. Payment category analysis - what each category reveals about influence strategies
    4. Top manufacturers - name specific companies and their engagement levels
    
    REQUIRED TABLES:
    1. Create a markdown table showing yearly payment trends:
       | Year | Providers | Total Payments | Average Payment | % Change |
    
    2. Create a markdown table of top 5 manufacturers:
       | Manufacturer | Total Payments | Providers Reached | Avg per Provider | Market Share |
    
    3. Create a payment categories breakdown table:
       | Payment Category | Total Amount | Transaction Count | Average Amount |
    
    Style: Investigative but data-rich. Use phrases like:
    - "The data reveals strategic targeting..."
    - "This level of penetration raises fundamental questions..."
    - "The trajectory of payments reveals..."
    
    TONE GUIDELINES:
    - Use neutral language: "payment patterns" instead of "strategic targeting"
    - Present data objectively without value judgments
    - Avoid phrases that imply intent or strategy
    - Focus on describing what the data shows, not interpreting intent
    - Use "observed patterns" rather than "reveals strategies"
    
    Integrate tables naturally within the narrative, not just at the end.
    Length: 400-500 words

prescription_patterns:
  data_required:
    - prescription_metrics
    - top_drugs
    - specialty_patterns
    - provider_type_analysis
  context: "Section 2: Prescription Patterns Analysis"
  prompt: |
    Analyze prescription data to reveal prescribing patterns across the health system.
    
    Data provided:
    {data}
    
    Focus on:
    1. Overall prescribing metrics and what they reveal about practice patterns
    2. Top prescribed drugs by value (name specific medications like Humira, Ozempic)
    3. Specialty-specific patterns that suggest targeted influence
    4. Provider type differences (MD vs NP/PA prescribing volumes)
    
    REQUIRED TABLES:
    1. Create a table of top 10 drugs by total cost:
       | Drug Name | Total Cost | Claims | Avg Cost/Claim | Unique Prescribers |
    
    2. If provider type data available, create comparison table:
       | Provider Type | Total Prescriptions | Total Cost | Avg Cost per Rx |

  prompt: |
    Write "The Quantification of Influence: Extreme Correlations in Clinical Decision-Making" section.
    
    Data provided:
    {data}
    
    This is the most critical section. Structure as:
    1. Opening about correlations that "challenge conventional understanding"
    2. Specific drug examples with influence factors (e.g., "Krystexxa: 426x increase")
    3. ROI calculations showing efficiency of influence

    | Drug Name | Prescribers w/ Payments | Avg Rx Value (Paid) | Prescribers w/o Payments | Avg Rx Value (No Pay) | Influence Factor | ROI |
    
    Use dramatic but precise language:
    - "profound correlations"
    - "systematic redirection of clinical decision-making"
    - "factors ranging from 92x to 426x"
    
    CRITICAL TONE GUIDELINES:
    - DO NOT claim causation from correlation
    - Use "associated with" or "correlated with", never "causes" or "leads to"
    - Include disclaimer: "These correlations do not establish causation"
    - Present findings as "observed associations" not "proven influence"
    - Be manufacturer-specific: "Providers receiving payments from [Company X]..."
    - Avoid: "systematic redirection", "cannot be explained by clinical factors"
    - Use: "statistical associations", "warrants further investigation"
    - Replace "profound correlations" with "notable associations"

       - providers_with_payments (number like 8,858)  
       - avg_rx_without_payments (dollar value)
       - avg_rx_with_payments (dollar value)
       - influence_factor (number with 'x' like 256.5x)
    
    2. "Pa Influence Metrics:" section contains Physician Assistant data with:
       - provider_count (number like 1,140)
       - providers_with_payments (number like 944)
       - avg_rx_without_payments (dollar value)
       - avg_rx_with_payments (dollar value)  
       - influence_factor (number with 'x' like 238.4x)
    
    3. "Np Influence Metrics:" section contains Nurse Practitioner data with:
       - provider_count (number like 2,087)
       - providers_with_payments (number like 1,764)

       - influence_factor (number with 'x' like 146.5x)
    
    CREATE THIS TABLE using the exact numbers from above:
    | Provider Type | Total Providers | With Payments | Avg Rx (No Pay) | Avg Rx (With Pay) | Influence Factor |
    |---------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
    | Physicians (MD) | [use provider_count from Md Baseline] | [use providers_with_payments] | [use avg_rx_without_payments] | [use avg_rx_with_payments] | [use influence_factor] |
    | Physician Assistants (PA) | [use provider_count from Pa Influence Metrics] | [use providers_with_payments] | [use avg_rx_without_payments] | [use avg_rx_with_payments] | [use influence_factor] |
    | Nurse Practitioners (NP) | [use provider_count from Np Influence Metrics] | [use providers_with_payments] | [use avg_rx_without_payments] | [use avg_rx_with_payments] | [use influence_factor] |
    
    After the table, analyze:
    - PAs show influence factor close to MDs (both over 200x)
    - NPs show lower but still significant influence (around 150x)
    - Implications for oversight and supervision
    
    ALL DATA IS PROVIDED ABOVE - DO NOT SAY "DATA NOT AVAILABLE"
    
    Key message: Mid-level providers show disproportionate influence from payments (ONLY if data supports this).
    Use terms like "heightened susceptibility" and "vulnerability gap" ONLY with real data.
    
    TONE GUIDELINES:
    - Replace "vulnerability" and "susceptibility" with "variation" or "differences"
    - Present as "observed patterns across provider types"
    - Avoid implying weakness or exploitation
    - Use neutral terms: "payment patterns", "prescribing differences"
    - Don't use: "heightened susceptibility", "vulnerability gap"
