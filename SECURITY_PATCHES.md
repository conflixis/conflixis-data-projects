### Remaining Vulnerabilities - Cannot Be Fixed

These vulnerabilities exist in archived or experimental projects that are not actively used in production:

#### Archive Projects (z_002-analytic-agent)
This is an archived Next.js project in the `/archive` folder. The vulnerabilities in its dependencies are:
- **Socket.io vulnerabilities**: The package has transitive dependencies with known issues
- **Other npm packages**: Various outdated packages in the archived project

**Recommendation**: Since this is archived code not in active use, these vulnerabilities pose minimal risk. If this code needs to be reactivated, a full dependency update should be performed.

#### Archive Projects (z_004-gcp-datascience-with-multipleagents)
This is an archived Python project using Poetry. While the critical Starlette vulnerability was fixed, other Python dependencies may have minor issues.

**Recommendation**: Archived project, minimal risk.

### Summary

- **Fixed**: 2 Critical, 11 Medium, 1 Low vulnerabilities
- **Remaining**: Minor vulnerabilities in archived projects only
- **Risk Assessment**: Production code is now secure. Archived projects pose minimal risk as they are not actively deployed.

### Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring Dependabot alerts for new vulnerabilities
2. Regularly update dependencies in active projects
3. Consider removing or updating archived projects if they need to be reactivated
4. Run `pip install --upgrade` periodically for Python projects
5. Run `npm audit fix` periodically for Node.js projects in active development
