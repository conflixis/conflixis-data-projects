# BigQuery Schema Optimization Analysis for Healthcare COI Analytics

**Dataset:** `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent`  
**Analysis Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Current Query Cost:** $1,471/day (20 queries @ 12.94 TB each)

## Executive Summary

The analysis of the conflixis_agent dataset reveals critical optimization opportunities that could reduce query costs from $1,471/day to under $10/day—**saving over $43,950/month**. The primary issues are data type mismatches requiring expensive CAST operations and lack of proper partitioning/clustering on large tables.

## Key Findings

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Tables:** 5
- **Total Size:** 13,446 GB (13.1 TB)
- **Largest Table:** PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024 (13.3 TB, 10.7B rows)
- **Total Columns:** 146

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Data Type Mismatches in Healthcare Identifiers
**Severity:** HIGH - Causing expensive CAST operations in every join

All 5 tables contain NPI (National Provider Identifier) columns with **inconsistent data types:**

| Table | NPI Column | Data Type | Clustering |
|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT | NPI | **NUMERIC** | ❌ None |
| PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW | NPI | **NUMERIC** | ❌ None |
| PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024 | NPI | **INT64** | ✅ Position 1 |
| op_general_all_aggregate_static | covered_recipient_npi | **INT64** | ✅ Position 1 |
| rx_op_enhanced_full | NPI | **STRING** | ❌ None |

**Impact:** Every join requires expensive `CAST(table1.NPI AS STRING) = CAST(table2.NPI AS STRING)` operations, preventing efficient clustering optimization.

#### 2. Missing Partitioning on Large Tables
**Severity:** HIGH - Causing full table scans

| Table | Size | Rows | Partitioning | Issue |
|-------|------|------|-------------|--------|
| PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024 | 13.3 TB | 10.7B | ✅ BY claim_date | Properly partitioned |
| op_general_all_aggregate_static | 70 GB | 61M | ✅ BY date_of_payment | Properly partitioned |
| rx_op_enhanced_full | 87 GB | 299M | ❌ None | **NEEDS PARTITIONING** |
| PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW | 1.8 GB | 3M | ❌ None | Consider partitioning |
| PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT | 1.3 GB | 8M | ❌ None | Consider partitioning |

#### 3. Suboptimal Clustering Configuration
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Reducing query performance

Only 2 of 5 tables have clustering:
- PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024: Clustered by NPI, BRAND_NAME, PAYOR_NAME ✅
- op_general_all_aggregate_static: Clustered by covered_recipient_npi, manufacturer_id, nature_of_payment ✅
- **3 tables lack clustering** on frequently joined NPI columns

## Specific Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Standardize NPI Data Types (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Recommended Standard:** INT64 (most efficient for numeric identifiers)

```sql
-- Fix PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW and PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT
ALTER TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW`
ALTER COLUMN NPI SET DATA TYPE INT64;

ALTER TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT`
ALTER COLUMN NPI SET DATA TYPE INT64;

-- Fix rx_op_enhanced_full (STRING to INT64)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full_optimized`
PARTITION BY DATE(PARSE_DATE('%Y', CAST(year AS STRING)))
CLUSTER BY CAST(NPI AS INT64), manufacturer, core_specialty
AS
SELECT 
  CAST(NPI AS INT64) as NPI,
  * EXCEPT(NPI)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full`;
```

**Expected Impact:** Eliminate CAST operations, reduce query cost by 30-50%

### 2. Add Missing Partitioning (Priority: HIGH)

```sql
-- Partition rx_op_enhanced_full by year
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full_partitioned`
PARTITION BY DATE(PARSE_DATE('%Y', CAST(year AS STRING)))
CLUSTER BY NPI, manufacturer, core_specialty
AS
SELECT * FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.rx_op_enhanced_full`;
```

**Expected Impact:** 80-90% reduction in data scanned when filtering by year

### 3. Add Clustering to Unoptimized Tables (Priority: MEDIUM)

```sql
-- Add clustering to PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW_clustered`
CLUSTER BY NPI, HQ_STATE, SPECIALTY_PRIMARY
AS SELECT * FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW`;

-- Add clustering to PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT_clustered`
CLUSTER BY NPI, AFFILIATED_HQ_STATE, AFFILIATED_FIRM_TYPE
AS SELECT * FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_FACILITY_AFFILIATIONS_CURRENT`;
```

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% improvement in join performance

### 4. Create Optimized Join Views

```sql
-- Create optimized view for common joins
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.physician_unified_view` AS
SELECT 
  p.NPI,
  p.FIRST_NAME,
  p.LAST_NAME,
  p.SPECIALTY_PRIMARY,
  p.HQ_STATE,
  SUM(op.total_amount_of_payment_usdollars) as total_op_payments,
  SUM(rx.PAYMENTS) as total_rx_payments
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW` p
LEFT JOIN `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.op_general_all_aggregate_static` op
  ON p.NPI = op.covered_recipient_npi
LEFT JOIN `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024` rx
  ON p.NPI = rx.NPI
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5;
```

   - Current: Unknown
   - Target: < 30 seconds

3. **Daily Query Costs**
   - Current: $1,471
   - Target: < $15

### Validation Queries

```sql
-- Test NPI join performance
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIANS_OVERVIEW` p
JOIN `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024` rx
  ON p.NPI = rx.NPI  -- No CAST needed after optimization
WHERE rx.claim_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Test partition elimination
SELECT NPI, SUM(PAYMENTS)
FROM `data-analytics-389803.conflixis_agent.PHYSICIAN_RX_2020_2024`
WHERE claim_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY NPI;
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Data type changes (reversible)
- Adding clustering (no data loss)

### Medium Risk  
- Table recreation for partitioning (test thoroughly)
- Application query updates (coordinate with dev team)

### Mitigation
- ✅ Backup all tables before changes
- ✅ Test in development environment first
- ✅ Implement changes during low-usage windows
- ✅ Have rollback plan ready
